Laundry

Title text: During the second semester, the path is briefly routed through the dishwasher.
Explanation[edit]
This comic is all about college laundry habits and how as time goes by, you end up just throwing clothes on the floor and then wearing them again.
In the first week, the student undertakes a proper laundry routine. However, due to increasing laziness, by the second week they have abandoned folding their clothes, and by the third week no longer bother hanging them in the closet. By the second month dirty clothes are no longer stored in a laundry hamper and are just dumped on the floor, and by the end of the semester clothes are not washed at all.
The title text seems to indicate that the student has a brainwave, some time later, to wash their clothes in the dishwasher along with the dishes. Presumably as a timesaver. The experiment was brief because dishwashers aren't actually any good at washing clothes[1] as they wouldn't move the clothes about.
Transcript[edit]
College Laundry Habits
[Panel labeled "First Week". 5 ovals arranged in a rough circle, with a clockwise path connecting them: "Dresser & Closet", "On Body", "Hamper", "Washer & Dryer", "Folding Area" (and back to the first). The area outside the ovals is labeled "Floor."]
[Panel labeled "Second Week". The path has been modified so that it does not go through "Folding Area" - only through the other 4 ovals.]
[Panel labeled "Third Week". The path has been modified so that it does not go through "Dresser & Closet". Only "On Body", "Hamper", and "Washer & Dryer" remain.]
[Panel labeled "Second Month". The path no longer passes through "Hamper" - only "On Body" and "Washer & Dryer".]
[Panel labeled "End of Semester". The path no longer goes to "Washer & Dryer", instead just looping back around from "On Body" to "On Body" again after passing through the "Floor."]

Discussion
I tend to skip straight to the last panel, unless there's a special occasion that necessitates a trip to the washing machine. Davidy22(talk) 07:09, 31 October 2012 (UTC)
Does this comic belong in the flowchart category? I guess it is a flowchart, but it does not seem to have multiple paths, and it does not match the rest of the flowchart comics. Reywas (talk) 22:55, 24 February 2015 (UTC)
I don't really understand the dishwasher in the title text. Explanation please?75.69.96.225 21:58, 1 April 2013 (UTC)
It refers to using the dishwasher as a makeshift washing machine. -- [[User:{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{1}}}|talk]]) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
I've added "and stress from due assignments". As a college student that have been through 4 years (with some 2,5 still to go), I know how that can change your routine. Although I can't relate to the clothes process per se. My knowledge in English is not 100%, so please correct that phrase if needed be. 108.162.254.65 03:26, 2 February 2014 (UTC)

I vote to keep it, but why is the citation needed not in the {{citation needed}} tag?? 108.162.237.167 12:56, 10 November 2021 (UTC)Bumpf

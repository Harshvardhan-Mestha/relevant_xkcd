Pillow Talk

Title text: Maybe I should've tried Wexler?
Explanation[edit]
The Bellman-Ford algorithm is an algorithm that calculates the shortest path(s) through a weighted digraph or collection of connected nodes or vertices. The "Wexler" in the title text refers to Wexler's algorithm, which is used to deal with the inverse problem of electrical impedance tomography, or simply stated: the electrical conductivity of an (inhomogenous) object.
Both of these would make terrible pillow talk. Pillow talk is the conversation made by lovers after they have had sex, and is usually relaxed and intimate instead of technical.
Transcript[edit]

Cueball: The Bellman-Ford algorithm makes terrible pillow talk.

How terrible of "pillow talk" it makes depends heavily on how geeky your significant other is. My wife has a T-Shirt that reads, "Talk Nerdy to Me!" -- mwburden 70.91.188.49 21:53, 13 December 2012 (UTC)
Electrical Impedance Tomography involves attaching electrodes to things ... was he not trying to get a bit kinky? -- 147.209.216.245 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)

The Race: Part 1

Title text: Great, and you JUST finished paying off the settlement over the Wayne Coyne hamster ball incident.
Explanation[edit]
This is possibly a continuation of 139: I Have Owned Two Electric Skateboards.
Firefly was a television series aired by Fox in 2002 that got cancelled mid-way through, but it has a large fan base nowadays (for a more comprehensive explanation, see the Wikipedia page). The star of the show was Captain Malcolm (or Mal) Reynolds, played by Nathan Fillion.
So in this comic, Megan tells Cueball that Nathan Fillion has an electric skateboard. Cueball immediately starts planning a trip to visit and race Nathan Fillion.
The title text refers to an earlier comic 211: Hamster Ball Heist, where Cueball kidnaps Wayne Coyne in his hamster ball.

Discussion
I read the last panel almost visualizing the scene, and "Gimme the computer. I want to Book a flight" has a strong rhyme with Sean Paul's Single [1], is it just me or Randall's got more in it ? 108.162.222.59ck

Bel-Air

Title text: Aaron Sorkin has been tapped to write the TV movie about the aging prince's eventual election to Pat Toomey's Senate seat, currently titled either 'FRESHman Senator' or 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'.
Explanation[edit]
This comic is a take on the 90s TV series Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and its much parodied and repeated theme song. Consequently, the song coming out of Cueball's TV right now is a take on that song. The joke is that Will Smith has somehow gone from being a successful rap star to an ambitious politician. Doggerel is a derogatory term for verse considered of little literary value or a comic verse of irregular measure, or in this case, rap music. Obviously, the song is updated with a reference to Adele, who was, of course, not performing during the series' run, seeing as she was two years old at its start.
In the last panel, Cueball is annoyed about this stupid show and he switches to another channel or turns the TV off. The timing of the "click" indicates that he became annoyed when the song turned into a political advertisement and/or he did not want to hear "some Adele for ya" be rhymed with the name of the city Philadelphia.
The title text refers to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, a 1939 Academy Award-winning movie about an idealistic young man who is chosen to be a Senator and soon finds himself battling corrupt politicians, perhaps as Will Smith might be in this comic. The two characters/character and actor is a coincidence that Randall plays on. Aaron Sorkin is the writer behind the comedy drama The American President and the creator of political television drama The West Wing. Pat Toomey is a current U.S. Senator of Pennsylvania (which includes Philadelphia), who was first elected in 2010.
The theme song of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was also referenced in 464: RBA.

Doggerel verse? Mixed with rap? What is this blasphemy? Davidy22[talk] 13:46, 8 January 2013 (UTC)
It seems that the 'click' was precisely timed so that Cueball could avoid hearing 'philadelphia' rhyme with 'adele for you'. I strongly support this decision. 108.162.219.223 06:10, 23 January 2014 (UTC)
Agreed, added to explanation. --Someone Else 37 (talk) 03:29, 24 April 2014 (UTC)

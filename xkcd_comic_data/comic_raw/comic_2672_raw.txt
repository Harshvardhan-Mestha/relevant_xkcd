This comic celebrates the release of Randall's new book, What If? 2, which was released on the same day as this comic: Tuesday, September 13, 2022. The comic thus appeared on a Tuesday, replacing that week's normal Wednesday release to coincide with the release day. The xkcd Header text also changed that day to shout out that the book was released on that day. (It had been counting down the last week, from less than a week, three days and one day while the previous comics 2670: Interruption and 2671: Rotation was on the front page — the latter only for one day due to the Tuesday release).
While announcing that his What If? 2 book is finally out (the entire comic is a link to the books page on xkcd), Randall gives us a flowchart we can follow to find an article in the book relating to the situation in the flowchart. Once a relevant possibility is reached in the flowchart a page number in the book is given. It thus assumes the reader plans to do something that the advice in What If 2 could be helpful for, which hopefully is highly unlikely. See the table below for explanations on the individual options in the flowchart.
The title text refers to the loop near the bottom of the flowchart, which involves a series of questions asking if the reader wants a progressively larger number of dogs. The number of dogs offered increases several times, and if that is sufficient the flowchart ends with fulfillment. Eventually it will have an option for the scenario where all in the universe is consumed by dogs, which directs to page 308 of the book. The title text references this last option by assuring the reader that all of the dogs are doing fine, but goes on to state that in itself could cause problems. For instance, those dogs could impede the progress of all life on Earth and elsewhere and/or reproduce and create an even larger population of dogs.
Table of questions in the flowchart[edit]
The flowchart questions and their possible answers are described in the following table(Also in 2672: What If? 2 Flowchart/Table):

Given: you just bought what if 2 -- why isn't "sit in your room reading 'What if 2' as if you have no obligations in the world" an option on the first what do you do? The answer is even a page number. - 108.162.216.227 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
I think the concept is how to use the book in your everyday life. i.e. Match your real-life quandaries to the book's good advice. -boB (talk)
Maybe you just want to read a good book every day? Barmar (talk) 16:05, 13 September 2022 (UTC)

Is any of those order links for What If 2 offering PDF version? -- Hkmaly (talk) 20:34, 13 September 2022 (UTC)
You could buy the Google Play Books version and download as .acsm with this. From that, you could open it with the Adobe Digital Editions app which is... less than ideal to say the least. But from there you will get a DRM protected .epub file. There are ways to remove the DRM, but that's as much as I can say. Long story short, just buy the ebook and don't get in trouble. TheMegax (talk) 13:20, 14 September 2022 (UTC)
Judging by the phrasing of the question I think they were asking about a legal, paid copy but as a pdf- perhaps for convenience or if the books don't ship to a certain country Char Latte (talk) 04:22, 15 September 2022 (UTC)
I've spotted a small logic bug committed by Randall: What if...the diner is in Rome? 141.101.76.117 17:48, 14 September 2022 (UTC)
There aren't any good diners, but there are plenty of denarii. I think that's what you're being confused with... :-p 172.69.34.84 20:31, 14 September 2022 (UTC)
zach weinersmith paid tribute: on this day SMBC's comic was two faceless stickmen against a white background (stickmen are drawn rarely in smbc, and normally they have faces) and the votey was "there's a new xkcd book! go buy it!". also the joke was a math joke (referencing the smallest uninteresting number paradox). --172.69.68.29 02:50, 15 September 2022 (UTC)
AWESOME! Perhaps we should host the explainsmbc wiki here until they get their own? 172.71.158.119 04:28, 15 September 2022 (UTC)

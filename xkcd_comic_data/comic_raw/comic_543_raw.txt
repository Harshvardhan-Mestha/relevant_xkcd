Sierpinski Valentine

Title text: Especially you mouseover text readers. You're the best. <3
Explanation[edit]
A Valentine's Day card from Randall to the xkcd readers. It is written inside a parody of the Sierpinski Triangle, a Sierpinski Valentine.
A Sierpinski triangle.
The Sierpinski Triangle is a fractal pattern made of triangles, covering a space. The way it works is to draw a triangle and draw another (upside down) one in the middle. Choose the upper, left and right triangle and repeat the process. Another valentine in the shape of a heart is 63: Valentine - Heart.
The <3 in the title text is an emoticon for a heart and goes out to those of his readers that read the title text. Those who read the title text are usually more devoted to know that such a thing exists.
Another relevant comic to the Sierpinski Triangle is 95: The Sierpinski Penis Game.
A "circular version", in a form known as an Apollonian Gasket, can be seen at 17: What If.
Transcript[edit]
[Shows an adaptation of the Sierpinski triangle fractal, using hearts instead of triangles.]
Happy valentine's day.

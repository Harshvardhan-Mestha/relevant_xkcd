December 25th

Title text: If you're turning 27 and were born in the Northeast, maybe you were conceived in the April blizzard of 1982. Imagine: snowed in, candles, massage oil, your mom sporting nothing but her early 80's haircut and a smile... aren't you glad you read the title-text?
Explanation[edit]
On Christmas Day, most kids whose families celebrate the holiday get Christmas presents. And kids who were actually born on the 25th may feel a little put off because they don't get a special day all to themselves like their siblings and friends do. A lot of families alleviate this by celebrating the child's birthday on a day other than the 25th, so the kid will still get their own party. Unfortunately, the child may not get double presents, but may instead end up getting one gift per gift-giver as both a Christmas gift and a birthday gift.
In the title text, Randall provided a "lovely" image for the people turning 27 on this date (Christmas Day, 2009) that would surely have them reaching for the brain bleach.
Transcript[edit]
[On one side, a family of four gathered around a Christmas tree, the daughter and son looking excitedly at the presents under the tree; on the other, a character wearing a party hat, sitting dejectedly before a birthday cake. The panel edges are decorated with holly and a wreath.]

Trust me. Even being within 30 days of Christmas affects ones birthday. You get fewer presents they're usually not very spectacular (those are reserved for the 25th) and parties are sparse or non existent. (Due to weather concerns and people are doing their Christmas shopping and can't be bothered.)
Here's the thing though if the only thing you do for your birthday is sharing a ce then you can complain 172.68.47.6 00:39, 9 November 2017 (UTC)

My birthday is December 22nd so I get a small overlap. -- Thejohnfan (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
The Hungarian version is "Imagine being born on the 24th of December, and being called Adam or Eve." In Hungary people celebrate Name Day, the day of the year associated with their given name. Evening of the 24th is the usual time of giving presents here. Also the day of Adam and Eve. 172.68.215.86 12:27, 6 December 2017 (UTC) q

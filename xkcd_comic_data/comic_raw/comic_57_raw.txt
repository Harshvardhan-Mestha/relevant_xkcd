Wait For Me

Title text: Opening dialogue by Scott
Explanation[edit]
This comic juxtaposes a familiar exchange with a surreal outcome.
Megan is returning after a short absence. Cueball reacts as if she had been gone for years, and admits to having an affair while waiting.
In this comic, a familiar exchange occurs where one person asks the other why they did not wait. The humor lies in the improbability of him falling in love and having an affair within 90 seconds, the impossibility of him having a son in that time, and the ridiculous notion that the son would now be about Megan's current age. This is of course impossible, as it would imply that Cueball experienced twenty-ish years of life in what felt like 1.5 minutes for Megan. (He might conceivably have managed to have sex in that time span, which would fit with the experience of Cueball in 1068: Swiftkey).
Scott appears to be a friend of Randall. Comics 57 through 59 all have the title text Opening dialogue by Scott, forming a sort of informal mini-series inspired by him. They are:
57: Wait For Me
58: Why Do You Love Me?
59: Graduation
As there already was a comic released on Monday that week, the first of these three was released on Tuesday, then Wednesday and Friday. This may be related to the fact that this was the first week where the comics were not also released on LiveJournal.
Transcript[edit]
[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another.]
Megan: Why didn't you wait for me?
Cueball: I thought you were gone forever!
[Megan throws out her arms, and Cueball is looking down.]
Megan: I said I'd be back in a minute!
Cueball: The... the seconds went fast at first, but then they started to drag on.
Cueball: She was there for me.
[Same scene as before, except Megan has her arms out less.]
Megan: You had an affair in the 90 seconds I was gone?!
Cueball: ...yes.
[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another in a smaller panel.]
Cueball: And we had a son.
[Same scene as before.]
Cueball: He'd be about your age now.

This could also be a reference to relativity, but I may be overthinking it. 130.160.145.185 06:24, 9 March 2013 (UTC)
I'm going with the more fantastical route. Cueball could have gone to Narnia in the ninety seconds she was gone. He could have had an affair and a child that is her age within that time. 72.193.184.110 10:51, 18 May 2013 (UTC)
And is maybe even a half-fawn? ;) 178.98.31.27 23:06, 24 June 2013 (UTC)
Who is "Scott"? He is mentioned here a couple of times so, we do need a category for him at this wiki.--Dgbrt (talk) 22:27, 25 June 2013 (UTC)
We already have a page for him. I've adjusted the two pages that refer to him in the title text to wikilink his name like the third already did. Mark Hurd (talk) 01:37, 26 June 2013 (UTC)
The 90 seconds could refer to time to read the comic for some people?87.242.215.146 14:13, 18 July 2013 (UTC)
I strongly feel that cueball is making a joke about relativity. 199.107.68.166 19:22, 20 September 2013
The joke is about relativity. A very popular example found in books is the so-called twin paradox, where one brother stays on earth and the other travels at a speed of light. When the traveling twin returns, he finds his brother having aged years while only hours had passed for the traveler.

I feel pretty strongly that Cueball's hesitation is more because he is embarrassed, than because he is joking. bringing cueball's son into the situation would then pull relativity into the matter. GallantChaos (talk) 17:51, 22 September 2013 (UTC)
It seems to me more like a sketch based on the premise of the Bill Nighy film About Time where the males of the family can travel backwards in time, sometimes changing the future as a result 141.101.99.214 10:57, 8 November 2013 (UTC)Pab
How could Randall have referenced a 2013 movie in 2006? -- Oh. I see what you did there. -- Madbadger2742 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
A woman announces: One minute...—that's the joke!--Dgbrt (talk) 21:38, 8 November 2013 (UTC)
He may be also referring to Star trek episode 'The Inner Light' 108.162.229.110 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
It is interesting to note that since the comic gradually reveals how much time has elapsed (or has been imagined/joked to have elapsed), it gives the impression of time accelerating as you read the comic. So if you read it quasi-statically, it seems that Cueball has merely been gone for long enough to have a son about Megan's age, but if you read dynamically, it seems that Cueball is getting older as he speaks, and will age and die before the conversation is over.

Why is it 'stereotypically female' to announce approximately how long task will take? In the UK, at least, men do this as well. 141.101.98.33 09:17, 4 April 2015 (UTC)

Wikipedian Protester

Title text: SEMI-PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION
Explanation[edit]
Cueball holds up a sign reading "[Citation needed]" during a political speech. The sign text is based on the Wikipedia template that can be placed next to statements that need citations, (that look like this[citation needed]) usually because of questionable validity. Cueball is using this template to challenge the politician's speech, as political speakers often throw out claims having dubious or no factual basis.
The title text below the comic, “Semi-protect the constitution”, represents an alternative sign the protester could be holding. It is a pun on an occasionally-heard phrase “protect the Constitution,” which urges politicians to pass and enforce laws in a way that preserves the rules and rights set down by the U.S. constitution. “semi-protect” references semi-protection, a protection measure applied to some articles on Wikipedia, which protects some articles from being edited anonymously. More specifically, it does not allow articles to be edited by people who have been on the wiki for less than 4 days or made less than 10 edits unless an administrator or event coordinator manually confirms them earlier. Semi-protection on an article is shown by displaying this lock on the top right of an article. Constitutional amendments cannot usually be proposed anonymously (more info)(Constitutional amendments are proposed by Congress, which isn't anonymous.[citation needed]), meaning that in effect, all articles of the Constitution are semi-protected.
Transcript[edit]
[A man with dark flat hair is standing at a podium. He is speaking to a crowd while standing behind a lectern. The lectern has a microphone on the top and sports an American flag in color on the side. He holds an arm on the lectern and the other arm is held up in front of him with a finger pointing upwards. There are four red stars on the side of the podium below him and behind him something that could be high curtains. There is an empty gap between the podium and the first people in the crowd followed by a stick with a red top, that indicates a fence to keep the crowd at a distance from the podium. After the fence there is a large crowd of people listening, most of them only partly drawn, only a few has hair. Three signs can be seen above the heads of the crowd, but they are all empty white signs. Except in the middle of the crowd, where Cueball has been raised above the rest of the crowd. He is holding a large sign up over his head in both hands. The sign has a blue text in black square brackets:]

Trivia[edit]
The xkcd store sells a sticker pack of "Citation Needed" stickers. (Currently Closed)
This comic is available as a signed print in the xkcd store. (Currently Closed)
Protestors in real life have made "Citation Needed" signs for the last few years as a joke.
It is a running joke in the what if? series (and thus this Wiki) to put "[citation needed]" after statements that are trivial [citation needed] or blatantly obvious. [citation needed] For example, "The Sun is bright, and its light illuminates the Earth.[citation needed]" Such statements are considered general knowledge and do not require citations.[citation needed]

Funnily enough, "Constitution" and "Constitution of the United States" are now semi-protected articles on Wikipedia due to excessive vandalism.

Does this need a citation? --Dalonacueball (talk) 16:30, 27 May 2015 (UTC)
No.[citation needed] Just some random derp 03:54, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
My favorite [citation needed] joke was the fact that the Wikipedia article for "List of Whales" used to have "Cetacean Needed" if it was missing an image or scale diagram of the creature in question. -Pennpenn 108.162.250.162 05:11, 23 November 2015 (UTC)
Still does! Thanks for pointing that out. Zeusfaber (talk) 18:41, 9 July 2016 (UTC)
Checked last week, there's still a cetacean needed for the page to be complete. ChessCake (talk) 22:20, 12 December 2018 (UTC)
Some anonymous wikipedia editor was enjoying themselves far too much when writing that wiki. Its so genius that no-one has changed it yet! Wikipedia is normally maintained pretty well for the big pages[citation needed]. sam0fc 14:49, 2 May 2019 (UTC)
Amazingly, it's still there! There's 12 of them still! aoijgpisbHtejsykl7ekderhtsjk6r64os4kys\\\[]jsrtjgdrghtvgwrhtejyku5dli6;78t7l6rk5j4h|||||#Rty-----WWWWWWfflfllfllfllfeogk0q9wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww4-cv;c;;c;c[;]z\]d;v[\]????????OH GOD IT'S CRASIHNG MY PC����������������������������������������������� (talk) 12:22, 5 November 2020 (UTC)
If you check the discussion, people have tried to change it before. But, strictly speaking, "cetacean needed" goes where they need an image of a cetacean. No citation is needed at all, and it is 100% fair to say that (an image of) a cetacean is, in fact, needed. Tsumikiminiwa (talk) 08:28, 5 April 2023 (UTC)
Is it just me or does the politician in this comic (from almost nine years ago) look suspiciously like Mr. Trump?--162.158.85.129 22:09, 18 May 2016 (UTC)
Nah, this one has better hair.173.245.56.29 00:25, 11 July 2016 (UTC)
Plus, this came out a long time before he became...big.[citation needed] Dontknow (talk) 19:42, 20 March 2017 (UTC)
Don't know how you define "big," but by most definitions Trump has in fact been "big" since *long* before this comic. [citation needed] Abcasada (talk) 22:20, 25 September 2018 (UTC)
Huh, in my memory, this comic specifically included the phrase "We hold these truths to be self-evident". I guess not - but I wonder if some Wikipedians would consider a [citation needed] for that one? Cosmogoblin (talk) 19:42, 30 January 2017 (UTC)

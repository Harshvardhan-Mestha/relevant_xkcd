Best-Tasting Colors

Title text: I recognize that chocolate is its own thing on which reasonable people may differ. Everything else here is objective fact.
Explanation[edit]
In this comic, Randall rates colors based on tastiness of various flavors, which makes it very similar to 388: Fuck Grapefruit. The colors are sorted in descending order (from most tasty to least tasty) by the midpoint of their overall taste range.
Within each color, several individual items are placed at points marked by dots along a tastiness scale, with nine ticks ranging from bad (1) to good (9). For example, within the pink color band at the very top, watermelon is only rated 6/9 — much less tasty than cotton candy, which is almost at 9/9, making it the very best tasting flavor in the chart. Interestingly, watermelon is mentioned twice, as it is also listed under green. Usually people do not eat the green part of a watermelon, so it is strange that Randall has rated both types at almost the same level of tastiness. It could be that he sees the green watermelon as green, but also sees the pink fruit inside, so it is actually the pink fruit that is rated for both colors, or the chart is a rating of candy (such as jellybean or popsicle) flavors, as it is not uncommon for both green and pink to represent watermelon in those situations.
For pink, blue and white there are one, two and three regions, respectively labeled with "???". It is not clear what the purpose of these is. Perhaps they indicate regions in which Randall is unable to think of any examples, and is inviting the reader to speculate. For instance, are there any pink-colored foods more tasty than watermelon (6/9) but less tasty than cotton candy (8.5/9)? It could also be that he thinks there must be other interesting foods with this color, which could seem to be the case for white and blue, where there are a group of question marks above the most tasty labeled flavor blue raspberries and vanilla for white. The latter is yet a joke, as vanilla is black, but is often used in white food such as vanilla ice, which he may have been thinking off, or just again messes with his readers.
The question marks thus imply an arbitrary tastiness assigned to a color that is not derived from an actual data point, however. For instance, the only blue datapoint is "blue raspberry", assigned a ranking of 5.5. But the range assigned to blue as a whole is 4 to 8. The regions on either side of the blue raspberry dot are labeled with ???.
There are a few exceptions with chocolate the most obvious as Randall makes a wide range for chocolate for brown, ranging from 2.5-9.5 out of 9. And the arrows here ends in single question marks indicating that the range could be even longer. In the title text he acknowledges the fact chocolate is its own thing and that regarding its taste reasonable people may differ in opinion.
The region for chocolate could not go further down because below the section for chocolate for brown food, there is another range with some other brown food items that Randall really does not like, caramel and especially coffee at 1.5/9. It may seem that Randall has never grown up to drink the drinks that society often dictates that you should drink. Not drinking Coffee (or hating it when you do) can be a problem with all the coffee breaks and meetings held over coffee etc. And as Randall has shown in 1534: Beer he also doesn't like beer...
Although it is not so clear as with chocolate pistachio is also split up with three lines indicating a range on the green from about 5 to 7 without any assigned point to their taste. And finally popcorn at 1.5/9 simply falls below the otherwise already low and slim rating range for yellow foods (2.5-3.5) with only lemon at 3/9 included. Many people love popcorn, but not especially for the corns actual taste, which is non existing if not for the adding of salt or sugar or other additives.
The worst taste by far to Randall, though, is licorice, and black food has a very small range from almost below 1 to less than 1.5. In USA it seems few people like licorice (although as most of the other mentioned food items, it may come in a wide variety of flavors and strengths). But in for instance northern Europe (Scandinavia) many people love it. See more explanations for all the mentioned flavors in the table below. It also seems that Randall's taste has changed over the nine years since the grapefruit comic.
In the title text, Randall asserts that his rankings of colors and flavors are indisputable (with the exception of chocolate). This together with rather obscure flavors included ("blue raspberry", "creamsicle") rather than more obvious choices, such as banana for yellow and carrot for orange could be a jab at the reception of his first food ranking comic, 388: Fuck Grapefruit which ranked fruits based on their tastiness and ease of consumption. Randall claims that it is the most controversial piece he has ever published. So all this is maybe just a way to generate even more controversy about this comic, and based on the discussion below he may have succeeded.
In 882: Significant researchers were studying the effect of eating 20 differently colored types of jelly beans (and all colors here are included except white).
Table[edit]
Color Item Explanation Rating (Approx.)
Pink Cotton Candy Randall seems to like cotton candy. This treat is sold in many places, most notably carnivals. 95%
Pink Watermelon Watermelon is a fruit that is used as a processed candy flavoring, especially in hard candies, and is usually very sweet and pink in color. The actual fruit is made of 95 percent water. 63%
Red Strawberry Strawberries are a seeded fruit which are usually sweet and red. They are of relatively small size. 93%
Red Cherry Cherries are red fruits that range from very tart to very sweet in taste. 86%
Red Raspberry Raspberries are reddish-pink fruits (though Randall lists them under red) that are in the more tart category of fruits. 55%
Blue Blue Raspberry Blue-colored raspberries are not found in nature. While some bramble fruit species and cultivars are sometimes referred to as "blue raspberry" - notably Rubus leucodermis - the actual color of such fruit varies between purple and black as it matures, closer to that of blackberries than for example blueberries.
While not a real fruit color, "blue raspberry" is nevertheless a common artificial flavor, ostensibly based on Rubus leucodermis. Products featuring this flavor are often artificially colored bright blue (nowhere near the hue of Rubus leucodermis fruit), contributing to the perceived association between the color and the flavor among general population.
57%
Green Green Apple Green apples are usually more sweet than red apples, which are not listed, and are Randall's favorite apple. He mentioned a dislike for red apples in his what if? Blog 84%
Green Watermelon (Rind?) While the red part of a watermelon and the pink watermelon flavoring used in candy are widely eaten and sweet, the green rind is hard and not normally eaten. It could also be a reference to how some types of candy color their "watermelon" flavor as green. 60%
Green Mint Mint is a herb that can be considered as spicy by some people, which makes it unappealing to them. 38%
Green Lime Limes are a green, sour fruit sharing many traits with lemons. These are rarely eaten as fruit, but can be served with water or beer. 31%
Green Pistachio Pistachios are green nuts. Randall seems unsure of where to place these on the chart. 47% to 70%
White Vanilla Randall is likely playing with expectations here. Vanilla and vanilla bean are both dark brown, not white. But vanilla ice cream is white thanks to the cream, milk, and sugar used in its creation. The brown is nearly invisible in the ice cream, either as vanilla extract mixed in or as minute flakes of vanilla bean in exceptional vanilla ice creams. 65%
White White Chocolate White chocolate is disliked by many people who assert that it is "not real chocolate" because it contains no cocoa solids and is mainly cocoa butter and sugar. 19%
Brown Chocolate Chocolate is given a very wide range. While widely recognized as a classic candy, containing the chemical phenylethylamine which literally makes the human brain happier, there are also very staunch and not rare people who clearly and adamantly don't like it. There are also many varieties of chocolate with varying degrees of sweetness -- and, not coincidentally, colors to help differentiate them. Randall deems the whole situation too complex to assign to only one data point. 38% to 86%. (range of text area)
Brown Caramel Caramel is a liquid-like substance usually drizzled on desserts. "Caramel" can also refer to the coloring. Randall seems to enjoy caramel less than many people. 19%
Brown Coffee While widely enjoyed by many people, coffee is a bitter beverage (or bean). Many people add sugar and/or cream to their coffee (or cover the beans in chocolate) to make it palatable. Clearly Randall does not like black coffee (coffee with no sweeteners or additives) 5%
Orange Creamsicle Orange creamsicle is an ice pop sold by Popsicle. It is known as a favorite among the Popsicle lineup. 47%
Orange Orange Oranges are round fruits similar in size to an apple. Randall appears to dislike oranges, maybe because of their slightly sour flavoring or the difficulty of opening one up.
Interestingly, in this comic Randall rates oranges as tasting worse than lemons, while in 388: Fuck Grapefruit, it was lemons he charted as tasting significantly worse.
25%
Yellow Popcorn?! Popcorn is a very popular food item, but not for its flavor. By itself it has nearly no flavor, and the usual toppings of salt and butter are some of the most basic cravings the human tongue asks for. 5%
Yellow Lemon Lemons by themselves have a very strong sour flavor. Many people, apparently including Randall, do not like this taste raw or on its own, though some do. To make lemons appealing to those who don't like very sour things, they are instead added as ingredients in a much larger dish, often with sugar added to balance the sourness. 27%
Purple Grape Randall apparently does not like Concord grapes, a small, oval-like purple fruit. He did not list green grapes, though. But given his previous comic 388: Fuck Grapefruit it seems likely that he like the green grapes very much as they were listed as some of the most tasty fruits 15%
Black Licorice Licorice has a strong bitter and spicy flavor. It is made from the root of the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra. Most Americans tend to find it a very unpleasant flavor. It would appear that Randall resides within that majority. 0.1%

It's possible that the watermelon being in the green section could be in reference to watermelon rind pickles 172.70.178.93 22:22, 11 March 2022 (UTC)
This is obviously wrong because white chocolate is not real chocolate. Let the flamewar begin. --172.68.54.34 15:22, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
Well, it's not technically chocolate, but it is a derivative -- insert math joke -- and the chart doesn't seem to be concerned with what it is, just with what it's called; after all, that which is called white chocolate by any other name would taste just as sweet, putting some off while others enjoy it.

I think those question marks at the top are supposed to be bubble gum.108.162.245.10 16:03, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
I suspect this is Randall's take on Fake News™, since it contains verifiably false claims such as coffee and liquorice being bad, and candy floss being better than watermelon
141.101.107.66 16:12, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
"In the title text, Randall asserts that his rankings of colors and foods are indisputable (with the exception of chocolate). This is of course ridiculous, as everyone knows that watermelon and strawberry are inherently superior to the likes of Citrus Fruits."...but his rankings of strawberry and of watermelon (x2) are higher than for oranges, lemons, and limes. There is no contradiction here; nothing that is ridiculous. 162.158.78.118 16:29, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
Liquorice, while an acquired taste certainly doesn't belong that far down, I'd take it over a long list of other things on the chart, but then again ... I'm Scandinavian 162.158.134.178 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
Sweet liquorice, or salted? I'm pretty sure there should be two dots there. Also, coffee and chocolate are both missing from the right end of the 'black' row. Most of the others, I think I'd flip the line, but keep each line in the same place. I guess taste is variable in weird ways 162.158.154.109 21:56, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
Hmm. The selection seems quite diverse compared to a standard bag of jelly beans, but doesn't really cover the range of a gourmet brand. I wonder where root beer falls, or Dr Pepper. And that's not even getting into color classification when the bean has more than one color. Personally, when I used to get gourmet jelly bean brands, I would do the squeeze-and-sniff test on a particular shade of brown, because it was used for both coffee and a flavor I liked. I remember Lore Sjöberg having a similar problem with cinnamon and cherry, but if he ever arrived at my solution, I don't know. Nyperold (talk) 16:44, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
Interesting theory that he's talking about flavors of jelly beans, though there's really nothing to indicate he is. But I believe every one of those food flavors are included in, for example, Jelly Belly's lineup (with the possible exception of a White Chocolate flavor). -boB (talk) 17:00, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
My take upon reading the comic was that it refers to Jelly Bellies. If you have ever tried a popcorn jelly belly you know how bad they are....172.68.65.72 23:32, 16 March 2017 (UTC)
I really like the "buttered popcorn" Jelly Bellys -boB (talk) 17:27, 17 March 2017 (UTC)
If you look at https://www.jellybelly.com/flavor-guides webpage though a lot of flavors from the comics are not jelly belly flavors.--Lul (talk) 11:52, 17 March 2017 (UTC)
I enjoy licorice and white chocolate, and I think strawberry is overrated. Fight me. 162.158.126.16 17:34, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
I don't think its necessarily jelly beans specifically. I think it's any candy that comes with multiple flavors in a pack, including jelly beans but not limited to them. (ie. also fruit snacks, Airheads, Necco Wafers, Jolly Ranchers, Sourpatch Kids, etc.) 16:47, 11 March 2020 (UTC)
If it is jelly beans it is definitely more agreeable then actual food. Because popcorn jelly beans are awful which explains why there a outlier. It also explains why there split by color. 172.68.58.89 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
It could also explain the question marks. They could be jelly beans for which he was not able to identify the flavor, but was able to judge it.162.158.79.5 13:16, 17 March 2017 (UTC)
Wow. I've seen stupidity, I've seen REAL stupidity, and now there comes this comic. Randall is confirmed for pleb taste.

My tastes now rate sweet tastes poorly - as well as sour, so I would down rate candyfloss, but not up rate lemon. The variability of chocolate represents the range from choc flavoured sweet margarine, through to 90% coco solids. My peak preference being about 50-60%. RIIW - Ponder it (talk) 18:14, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
Patrician taste good sir. Though, I respectfully disagree with your opinion on sour only somewhat: Lemons combined with other flavors make lemons pretty dang tasty. 173.245.50.96 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)

“Most people” do not like licorice; Most Americans, you mean. Licorice is extremely popular in Europe in many varieties. But they don’t like root beer. 108.162.246.227 06:04, 16 March 2017 (UTC)
AFAIR in pretty much every food item common to the US and the UK, the US version had a far larger sugar content. My theory is that salt was more expensive that sugar everywhere but the coastal regions, so preserving with sugar was the way to go and hence the apparent national "sweet tooth" RoyT (talk) 08:04, 16 March 2017 (UTC)
Hello. As a european myself, i can assure you that Licorice is not extremly popular here, except among some loners, who are recieved and watched critically by their fellow europeans. Most people in Europe don't like it. Also, most people in Europe heard of rootbeer, but nearly noone ever drank it - i wouldn't even know where to get it here. --162.158.91.149 10:08, 16 March 2017 (UTC)
You can't speak for most people in Europe. Tastes are really different according to which countries you speak about. There are lot of European alcohols with licorice flavors and also lot of licorice candies... -- Lul (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
Wait, lemons? I like lemons. Anyone with an excess of raw lemons for eating should send me them. I would eat them consistently if it weren't for the fact that doing so makes my gums sore afterwards. I've several times distilled lemon juice into a much, much stronger "lemon syrup" with about 1/10th the volume and the consistency of maple syrup, and my general feeling is that I would eat it like candy if it were widely available, even though it has virtually no sugar in it. Lemon flavor is best flavor! 172.68.133.132 07:51, 16 March 2017 (UTC)
Lemon juice has plenty of sugar in it. That's why it's used for invisible ink. 198.41.238.16 08:28, 16 March 2017 (UTC)

The watermelon flavor of Airheads candy is completely green. Also, many watermelon candies partially include a green part to mimic the appearance of watermelon, and even though they taste the same, may elicit a false feeling of tasting better. 76.252.228.30 12:04, 16 March 2017 (UTC)
"???" refers to the mystery Dum Dums flavor. I'm pretty sure about this. 108.162.216.130 21:18, 21 March 2017 (UTC) This is some manchild pleb taste. "EWW COFFY NASTY >:( MOMMY I WANT SWEET :O" seriously. 173.245.50.96 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)

The question marks for blue might have to do with George Carlin's lament over the lack of blue food.CoderLass (talk) 21:53, 20 March 2017 (UTC)
So Randall talks about the flavor of colors based on the food they are associated with, but he says "blue" and doesn't mention blueberries and says "black" but doesn't mention blackberries? WHAT? Were they just not good enough? --JayRulesXKCD what's up? 15:18, 4 April 2017 (UTC)
I took this as being about artificial colors. That also explains the ??? areas. So, it is a guide for when getting e.g. icecream, bubblegum, yoghurt, etc. to which colour to pick, regardless of their labels... am I really alone with this? --Lupo (talk) 12:26, 1 October 2019 (UTC)
Cotton candy's original color is obviously white, how did it managed to end up as pink at all? Also, Randall have a good metaphorical taste, but a terrible literal one. 162.158.203.25 03:08, 9 January 2021 (UTC)
I think cotton candy being rated highest is a joke not mentioned so far. As another commenter mentions above, an alternate (English?) name for the product is "candy floss". It's literally sugar, just served in the form of fibers. It has the following flavor: sugar. (I understand that some cotton candy is now flavored. Nevertheless, it's "cheap fruit-flavored candy" in that case, which no adult can actually like.) Randall was kidding. Nitpicking (talk) 04:07, 10 December 2022 (UTC)

Commemorative Plaque

Title text: [Below] On this site on May 12th, 2023, I finally learned how to use the masonry bit for my drill.

The narrator discovered that it is simple and inexpensive to have a commemorative plaque made, and so had a commemorative plaque made to record that event. This comic is similar to previous comics, especially 699: Trimester, which also uses as its subject how easy it can be to fool people into accepting something trivial or incorrect through the use of official hallmarks or labor-intensive processes (such as engraving a plaque & affixing it to a wall). The comic both indicates the lack of knowledge many people have about how simple or difficult it is to do a certain thing, and the over-the-top response a person might have to a relatively mundane discovery.
The comic was published on May 5, the holiday of Cinco de Mayo, Europe Day and Dutch Liberation Day, and the day before the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla. The comic subverts an expectation that a plaque about May 5 would be to commemorate either one of the many world events that previously took place on a May 5 in various years, or more specifically the 1862 Battle of Puebla or the 1964 founding of the Council of Europe or the 1945 Liberation of the Netherlands, which all took place on May 5 and inspired the respective holidays.
The title text describes a second plaque mounted below the first one, boasting that a week later they learned out how to use a masonry bit, presumably to mount the first plaque.

Any bets on how many copies of this plaque people send him? Jordan Brown (talk) 00:25, 6 May 2023 (UTC)
I do not understand the plaque... If the test is correct, shouldn't there be an order button for not that expensive commemorative plaques on xkcd.com/2772? Questions over questions...Tier666 (talk) 07:31, 6 May 2023 (UTC)
By site, they mean "location". It was in that location when Randall figured out what is on the plaque. 172.71.82.17 14:08, 7 May 2023 (UTC)Bumpf
Because it's vague, not worth an Explain expansion, but I'm wondering how much of the intervening week was delivery time of the original plaque (assuming the "lesson learnt" moment was the instant the original plaque was ordered, as it was too late on receipt to then make the claim of the achievement appear upon it). And it sounds like the plaquer had the bits handy (standard "202 different bits, screwdriver heads, sockets and related hardware"-type everyman-handyman accessory kit that you might get 'because why not?'/’it was marked as a deal!' on one visit to the hardware depot) but just had never (properly?) used the whole masonry set in anger, until now. And I don't discount the possibility that the second plaque was ordered to place over some initial ill-drilled holes from the first attempt at mounting (either done without regard to where further holes would need to align to the mortar bonds and courses, or an attempted to take advantage of that but badly), making the announcement of the second 'triumphant' occasion instrumental in legitimately masking the evidence of the learning process that led up to it. 172.70.86.154 08:48, 6 May 2023 (UTC)
I wonder if that's an oblique reference to the commemorative plaque Dieter Meier had had installed at the Kassel railway station in 1972 that announced him standing there 22 years later? 172.68.51.141 11:22, 6 May 2023 (UTC)
In Denmark we celebrate the liberation from the Germans at the end of WW2 on May 5th 1945. And later also my birthday ;-) --Kynde (talk) 12:08, 6 May 2023 (UTC)
A bit of time paradox here. . . . . If he didn't figure out how to use a masonry drill until 12 May, then the top plaque couldn't have been installed before then. And the lower plaque would have been ordered, delivered and installed sometime after 12 May. Can we expect a third plaque commemmorating the mounting of the first and second? If so, when? 172.68.210.5 01:12, 7 May 2023 (UTC) Beechmere
No idea about the second, but I would assume that on 12 May, he ALSO installed the top plaque. -- Hkmaly (talk) 03:46, 7 May 2023 (UTC)
5/5, figured out the plaques thing and ordered one (or sat on it, ordered a day or two later). ⩽12/5, received plaque and tried to install. 12/5, successfully installed, second plaque ordered (or possibly shortly after). >12/5, received and installed second plaque. 172.71.242.202 10:00, 7 May 2023 (UTC)
Which makes this technically a science fiction comic, as it was released on 5/5. 172.68.50.127 14:30, 7 May 2023 (UTC)
It was a few years ago when I learned how to use masonry drills. An importand difference is whether you use a “Schlagbohrmaschine” or “Hammerbohrmaschine”, and you need the correct bit for both. Now I am frustrated that English uses the same word for both of them. The first one (cam action) has a disgusting user experience, while the second one (pneumatic) is a joy. --162.158.110.218 19:54, 7 May 2023 (UTC)

Old Drawing

Title text: I don't want to talk about it
Explanation[edit]
This comic plays off the pun between stumped, meaning confused or at a loss, and a stump, which is the remnants of a tree that has been cut down.
Anyone snooping into his journal would be punished by such a terrible pun. The pun is so terrible that even Randall does not want to talk about it, as he mentioned in the title text.
Transcript[edit]
[A tree holding a chainsaw over a recently cut-down tree. The first text is in a frame at the top of the panel.]
I found this in one of my high-school notebooks. I think I drew it just to take revenge on people snooping through my stuff.
Tree stump: Well, you stumped me...

I used to frighten people going through my stuff with occasional pictures of Cthulhu standing on a pentagram with the norse runes for "all hail the destroyer of souls" around it, just to make their day a little weirder. -- Gigahertz (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
Why is the pun so terribly punishing? (no pun intended) Benjaminikuta (talk) 07:31, 11 August 2014 (UTC)
I personally think that the comic means that the cut down tree is both a stump, and confused, no pun intended.

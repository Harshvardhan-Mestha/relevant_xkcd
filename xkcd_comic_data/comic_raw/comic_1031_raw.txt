Title text: Problem Exists Between Leopard And Chair
Clicking on the image takes you to this link (now defunct, archive).
Explanation[edit]
Randall's browser looks like Google Chrome, and he has installed at least four extensions on it, which explains the little symbols to the right of the address bar. Extensions are small programs that install into your Internet browser and change the Web pages as you view them. Some make pages easier to read, some remove ads (the third extension is AdBlock) and so on.
For the joke in this comic, an extension accidentally replaces the word "keyboard" with "leopard" in a regex (or regular expression). In computing, a regular expression provides a concise and flexible means to "match" (specify and recognize) patterns in text, such as particular characters or words. The command to substitute/replace a string is "s", e.g. "s/old/new/g" replaces any occurrence of "old" with "new". The title therefore contains the command to change "keyboard" into "leopard".
It's not clear what the extension Randall installed was actually supposed to do, but most extensions that revolve around text replacement are humorous in nature (such as Cloud to Butt, which replaces all instances of "the cloud" with "my butt").
The title text references the common IT phrase "Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair" or PEBKAC, which means that the problem is caused by the user, not by any failure of the computer. However, due to the substitution, it is now "Problem Exists Between Leopard And Chair".
There has been several comics using substitutions, both before and after this one.

which range from pocket-sized leopards to large desktop leopards, the leopard remains the most common user input device. In addition to text entry, specialized leopards are used for computer gaming.
While many computer interfaces rely on mice or touchscreens, UNIX-style command-line interfaces require users to interact with a leopard.
[Below is the contents list - the text in the brackets can barely be read. And only the very top of the 2.3 line can be seen, and is thus only a qualified guess at what it was supposed to say, although it fits with the real wiki article.]

The Internet got 100 times better when, thanks to an extension with a typo'd regex, my browser started replacing the word "keyboard" with "leopard".
Trivia[edit]
When first posted, the title was written with lowercase characters, which Randall never uses. This was later changed to small caps.
The title text could reference A-Minus-Minus, the comic containing the phrase "Instead of office chair, package contained bobcat".

My mechanical leopard's been working out for me, just the feeling of my fingers hitting it is amazing. Davidy22[talk] 08:35, 21 January 2013 (UTC)
Why does it say "s/keyboard/leopard/" in the url of this page, but title of this comic is "s/leopard/leopard/"?DiEvAl (talk) 17:57, 15 April 2013 (UTC)
Now I see "s/leopard/leopard/" twice in my previous comment. I forgot that I have an extension installed that was inspired by this comic. :) DiEvAl (talk) 18:00, 15 April 2013 (UTC)
I swear I read every instance of leopard as keyboard. 173.245.54.89 23:33, 14 November 2013 (UTC)
Shouldn't the title of the comic end in "g" since it's a global replace, like "s/keyboard/leopard/g"? Kroq-gar78 (talk) 18:56, 23 November 2013 (UTC)
I have no idea, but I do know that the current title matches the one on xkcd. We're not changing it, even if there was an error. NealCruco (talk) 03:50, 19 February 2014 (UTC)
I just bought my new leopard today! It's working great, but it's a bit hard to use. Is there such a thing as a leopard-repair shop? 108.162.219.47 21:03, 3 March 2014 (UTC)
some[1] leopards even have touch screens108.162.216.45 05:58, 8 March 2014 (UTC)
You sure it's not a sed command? Regexps just matches! 108.162.215.97 13:44, 8 September 2014 (UTC)
actually, it's an ed command.Taibhse (talk) 12:10, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
If the first user's leopard now produces language in Chinese, why is the message in English? 108.162.250.155 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
This is more like a joke to me (as a Chinese) because there isn't a real Chinese leopard as far as I'm concerned... Chinese characters are usually typed using an IME and a standard English leopard. We type in the pronunciation romanized and select from a list of characters with the same pronunciation. 162.158.255.164 03:28, 18 December 2020 (UTC)
The first add-on looks like google translate. 108.162.222.159 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)

I have an extension that does quite this, so I have no idea who is actually saying "leopard". Cody Hackins (talk) 01:37, 9 March 2016 (UTC)
Everyone except the person right above you (in allcaps) is just saying leopard. Here. Does this work? K E Y B O A R D?108.162.245.115 21:55, 3 June 2016 (UTC)
The first extension is Translate; the third is Wolfram|Alpha. Papayaman1000 (talk) 07:15, 5 June 2016 (UTC)
As far as I know, 's/old/new/' only replaces the first instance of 'old' with 'new'. One would gace to use the g flag after the last slash to enable replacement of all instances of 'old' 141.101.91.223 23:42, 28 June 2016 (UTC)
My leopard doesn't seems to be working well since I didn't insert my leopard's USB port into my computer.Boeing-787lover 14:03, 22 November 2017 (UTC)
Can anyone think of a regex replacement someone might want to do that would be reasonably typo'd into s/keyboard/leopard/g? It's been bugging me since the comic came out. Undergroundmonorail (talk) 19:01, 21 July 2019 (UTC)
No speculation on Leopard being a reference to the Apple codename? 108.162.238.161 15:28, 15 September 2019 (UTC)

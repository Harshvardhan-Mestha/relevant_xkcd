Substitutions 3

Title text: BREAKING: Channing Tatum and his friends explore haunted city
Explanation[edit]
This is the third comic in the Substitution series where Randall has suggested substitutions that will make reading the news more fun. This time it will be even more fun! But there have been several comics using substitutions both before and after these ones.
The series as of 2022:
1288: Substitutions
1625: Substitutions 2
1679: Substitutions 3
The title text in original form would be "Scientists explore ancient city", which most would consider a fairly bland headline. Two days before this comic came out, there was news that a potential ancient Mayan city had been found by a 15 year old boy through satellite imagery, which may be what Randall was referencing. The Mayan city has now been proven nonexistent. Imagining Channing Tatum and his "friends", and pretending that the city is haunted, provides a much more dramatic setting mirroring many episodes (and later films) of Scooby Doo featuring a gang of friends (Mysteries, Inc.).
Table of Substitutions[edit]
Original word/phrase Meaning Substitution New meaning
Gaffe A social mistake, faux pas Magic spell A form of sorcery
Ancient Very old Haunted Occupied by ghosts, spirits, etc., spooky
Star-studded Featuring a lot of popular celebrities Blood-soaked Full of blood, or a place where a lot of violent deaths occurred
Remains to be seen Unknown as of yet, speculative Will never be known Can never be determined, final statement indicating we've given up trying to understand, etc.
Silver bullet Perfect solution Way to kill werewolves In werewolf folklore, a silver bullet was usually the only way to actually kill a werewolf. The phrase "silver bullet" is usually used to mean something like "perfect solution" — this substitution suggests the more literal meaning of the phrase.
Subway system A network of underground tunnels for commuter trains Tunnels I found A more personal and colloquial way to refer to underground tunnels, as though they had just been discovered for the first time.
Surprising Unexpected Surprising (but not to me) The speaker/writer claims that everyone else is surprised by something, but they had anticipated it all along.
War of words Public arguments, smear campaigns, etc. Interplanetary war A major conflict involving the civilizations of multiple planets (as seen in e.g. War of the Worlds). ("Well, that escalated quickly.")
Tension Anxiety, conflict between people or groups Sexual tension Situation in which two or more people attempt to avoid acknowledging being sexually attracted to each other.
Cautiously optimistic A guarded statement of optimism about a situation Delusional Firmly believing something in spite of clear evidence to the contrary

Win votes To make a politician more popular and more likely to win an election Find Pokémon To collect virtual creatures in a popular video game series
Behind the headlines Usually, to go into greater depth on a news story Beyond the grave To communicate with (or experience) life after death
Email / Facebook post / Tweet All are forms of electronic communication. The last two are forms of social networking. Poem An artistic form of writing that usually involves rhyming and meter.
Facebook CEO At time of writing, Mark Zuckerberg This guy Any generic person. Sometimes used in a derogatory fashion, or to refer to one's self.
Latest The most recent in a series Final The last entry in a series (as in, there won't be any more).
Disrupt Interrupt, temporarily hinder Destroy Make completely inoperable, remove all trace of, etc.
Meeting A gathering of people to discuss a topic, as in business Ménage à trois One or more sex acts performed among three people.
Scientists A group of people considered authorities in various scientific realms of study Channing Tatum and his friends A famous actor and a group of people closely associated with him. The name was likely chosen at random.
You won't believe A catchphrase used in "click-bait" headlines to attract attention and traffic I'm really sad about A different catchphrase expressing disappointment in the topic

The title text may be a reference to the Mayan city discovered by a 15 year old, but that city hasn't yet been visited by scientists or Mr Tatum. https://translate.google.com/translate?tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.journaldemontreal.com%2F2016%2F05%2F07%2Fun-ado-decouvre-une-cite-maya 198.41.239.34 13:32, 11 May 2016 (UTC)

Is there a way to easily enable/disable the extension?Bmmarti3 (talk)
It appears there isn't... Go to your list of browser extensions, and enable/disable it.141.101.75.245 18:59, 11 May 2016 (UTC)
I personally use a different extension than was linked to on xkcd.com, titled xkcd substitutions, which can be turned off by clicking on the icon for it at the top of your Chrome window, and also allows you to set specific sites on which it will never change words (i.e. on Gmail).

It would be wonderful if the celebrity injunction was about a ménage à trois and somehow all the hype was Randall's fault. 141.101.70.133 15:13, 11 May 2016 (UTC) Great. Now I have to update this:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xkcd-substitutions/jkgogmboalmaijfgfhfepckdgjeopfhk?hl=en&gl=001 --108.162.215.69 18:24, 11 May 2016 (UTC)
108.162.216.91Here's a funny link, but I don't know how to edit it in: https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/how-clintons--scandal-took-root/2016/03/27/ee301168-e162-11e5-846c-10191d1fc4ec_story.html, it the substituted version is "How Clinton’s poem scandal took root"108.162.216.91
On Doctor Who > Big Bang Theory - the real life example isn't particularly interesting, as it's substituting one TV show for another. The more interesting cases are those where news headlines reference an actual doctor, who (something). For instance, in the criminal trial of amputee Oscar Pistorius, one TV banner referred to someone as "Doctor who cut off [his] legs". "The Big Bang Theory cut off [his] legs" is, to my mind, more bizarre. 141.101.98.119 16:54, 12 May 2016 (UTC)Andrew Williams; one day I'll make an account. 12/05/2016
I think any article about Doctor Who - e.g. an interview with David Tennant about his leading role on The Big Bang Theory, would come across as funny to Whovians. :) KieferSkunk (talk) 20:08, 16 May 2016 (UTC)

Weird substitution
Isn't 'tension' -> 'sexual tension' weird? It could result in the following texts:
'sexual tension' -> 'sexual sexual tension',
'cable tension' -> 'cable sexual tension'.
In short, whenever there's already something before 'tension' that gets modified, don't substitute (or replace those words (difficult to do automatically)) --Zom-B (talk) 07:43, 12 May 2016 (UTC)

Important Life Lesson

Title text: I didn't even know I *had* the Monty Python 'Lumberjack' song.
Explanation[edit]
It's common to have music playing in the background when two individuals decide to engage in sexual behavior. However, some people have a lot of silly or funny songs in the same music library as their more dramatic or romantic song choices. If the library is left to randomly choose songs from the whole library, those more whimsical songs could easily come up, suddenly ending the intimate mood.
Cueball is performing cunnilingus on Megan, while a particularly goofy song, the Power Rangers Theme, plays in the background. The title text alludes to an even sillier song, the Monty Python song Lumberjack, which is about a transvestite lumberjack.
Transcript[edit]
Important life lesson: If there's any possibility of sex, do not leave your music library on "shuffle all."
[Megan lies down in a bed, while Cueball is beneath the bed sheets with his head between her legs. On the other side of the room, a computer is turned on and playing music.]
Megan: *GASP* MMMMM-
Computer: GO GO POWER RANGERS!

If there's anything more important than Cunnilingus, I want it caught and shot now. —Kazvorpal (talk) 01:46, 30 November 2019 (UTC)
Meghan seems to be enjoying the tempo, so maybe its an awesome idea instead?

Drawing Stars

Title text: Screw these 36-degree angles. I'm converting to Judaism.
Explanation[edit]
Randall attempts to draw a five-pointed star; the easiest way to do this free-hand is by drawing a pentagram, the simplest regular star figure in geometry. Once you've seen it done, you can usually draw a pentagram in one continuous motion.
Simply put, Randall gets self-conscious and messes up.
The title text explains the fact that a five-pointed star has all angles at 36 degrees which sums to 180, like a common triangle. So Randall converts to Judaism with its six pointed star symbol, which he hopes is easier to draw because it is composed of two equilateral triangles. This also suggests that he is converting from neopaganism[actual citation needed] just to have a religious star he can draw well.
Transcript[edit]
HOW TO DRAW A STAR:
[A slightly curved line is drawn, starting with a point near the top center of the panel, and going downward and to the left at approximately a 23-degree angle, with an arrow at the end.]
[Another slightly curved line goes up and to the right, creating a 34-degree angle with the first line.]
So far so good...
[A third line goes up and to the left, creating a 58-degree angle with the last line. The drawing now sort of resembles a tent being blown over in the wind.]
Steady as she goes...
[The fourth line goes down and to the right, creating an approximately 47-degree angle with the last line, and our star is beginning to look a bit askew.]
...uh oh.
Shitshitshit
[The fifth line comes up at a 48-degree angle, completely missing the first point by a mile, and our star has failed spectacularly.]
ABORT!
ABORT!

They are however, incredibly easy to sew[1] 146.115.187.103 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
The nice thing about knowing lots of geometric stars is that I could have easily salvaged that to make a slightly squashed 8-pointed star polygon (a.k.a. octagram, Schläfli symbol {8/3}). --Quicksilver (talk) 06:11, 17 August 2013 (UTC)
Same here lol. I tried right after I read it and I actually got a tridecagram {13/5} thing. 108.162.222.148 16:54, 7 March 2015 (UTC)

The cursor and the drawing looks a bit like [turtle mode], that would explain the "Abort abort" reaction as the user would like to stop the script where it is. 108.162.229.111 12:01, 17 July 2015 (UTC)
He actually looks like he's very much on the right track to drawing an octogram. 108.162.219.226 21:23, 18 May 2020 (UTC)

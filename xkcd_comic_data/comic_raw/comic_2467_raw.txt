Wikipedia Caltrops

Title text: Oh no, they set up a roadblock which is just a sign with the entire 'Czech hedgehog' article printed on it.
Explanation[edit]
Cueball's car has a collection of Wikipedia links spilling out of the trunk, meant to stop Hairy who's in the following car. The idea is that by dropping a series of interesting links, one could stop someone else's movement as they take the time to go through them all, provided that they are also easily distracted. This is analogous to the caltrops mentioned in the title; caltrops are small, spiked implements that are scattered on a road to slow down someone pursuing you. Hence the title of Wikipedia Caltrops.
Wikipedia is also a website that is notorious for having many links to other pages, which may result in a "wiki walk", a dilemma for Randall that has been discussed previously in 214: The Problem with Wikipedia (and separately with TV Tropes in 609: Tab Explosion).
This strategy is similar to a weaponized version of 356: Nerd Sniping, using the high levels of focus that tend to come along with nerdy interests against someone. Munroe apparently reasons that, because these links would stop him in his tracks, they might do the same for a given target.
The Wikipedia links include:
1808 mystery eruption: A conjectured volcanic eruption
1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game: The most uneven college football game in history
1994 Caribbean Cup#Anomaly: A soccer game where group stage qualification rules had unintended consequences
American death triangle: An unsafe type of rock climbing anchor
AVE Mizar: A 1970s flying car
Bald-hairy: A Russian political theory about state leaders' hairstyles
Boeing YAL-1: A laser weapon mounted on a military aircraft
Bubbly Creek: A stretch of river in Chicago featured in The Jungle
Burned house horizon: An area where Neolithic people burned their settlements
Defence Scheme No. 1: A 1920s plan for Canada to attack the USA
Elsagate: A YouTube controversy involving inappropriate videos being categorised as child-friendly
Fastest animals#Invertebrates: Very fast insects, and some squid
Flying ice cube: An effect in molecular dynamics simulations
Future of Earth#Introversion: A model of future continental drift in which the Atlantic closes up
Hairy Hands: A ghost story in Dartmoor, England
January 0: December 31st in some software programs
List of fictional colors: Impossible colours in fiction
List of unexplained sounds: Mostly detected by NOAA, includes the Bloop
Talk:List of U.S. states and territories by elevation#Delaware - Ebright Azimuth: A user argues the highest point in Delaware isn't Ebright Azimuth, but a trailer park
Mosquito laser: A proposed device for killing mosquitoes
Pheasant Island: An island shared equally between France and Spain
Time in Australia#Anomalies: Places in Australia which do not use the expected time zone
Timeline of the far future: Scientific speculation
Walkalong glider: A type of unpowered model aircraft
Mentioned in the title text, a "Czech hedgehog" is an anti-tank obstacle made of metal, essentially a large caltrop. It would be an effective roadblock, however a sign describing it would not impede most traffic, [citation needed] only for those distracted as easily as Randall.
Transcript[edit]
[Cueball drives a car, followed by another car driven by Hairy. Cueball is leaning on the open window looking back as 24 large paper slips with Wikipedia links are flying out of the open trunk of the car. They extend to the front of Hairy's car, obscuring that all the way up to Hairy's position in the car. None of the links can be read in full, and only on a few can parts of the actual link be seen. Many has only part of the pages title visible, some parts are obstructed partly by other slips in front of them or they have not entirely left the trunk. In once case the link is so long that it has been split on two lines on a thicker slip. There is a large part of the link that cannot be seen after the first line, but the end of the second line can be seen as well. Here the (fairly) readable parts are give, roughly in normal reading order.]

I have a collection of Wikipedia links to throw behind my car if I'm ever being chased by someone as easily distracted as me.

seems more like flares (which distract) than caltrops (which physically impair) to me. 162.158.222.122 16:31, 24 May 2021 (UTC)
I'd say "Well, I now know what I'm doing for the next few hours!", except that I suspect that this isn't even going to be the half of it... 141.101.98.46 16:37, 24 May 2021 (UTC)

except 'caltrops' is a funnier word than 'flares' and we get the gist anyway. 108.162.237.4 17:23, 24 May 2021 (UTC)
no WAY randall is a jon bois fan 173.245.52.175 17:38, 24 May 2021 (UTC)
Flares draw fire to prevent missiles from reaching their target. Caltrops impede the actual motion of the vehicle. If the links are as distracting as Randall implies, I think his choice makes sense! 108.162.215.92 00:34, 25 May 2021 (UTC)
Flares do " draw fire" but because they are more visible to heat seeking missiles than engine jet engine heat. This seems like a solvable problem, missile and flare wise.162.158.75.202 03:44, 25 May 2021 (UTC)
"Chaff" might work, right? Jkshapiro (talk) 14:54, 15 May 2022 (UTC)
Shouldn't the links be given as QR codes rather than plain text, which would have to be read and re-typed into a device with a suitable web browser? 108.162.219.28 00:54, 25 May 2021 (UTC)
Having to type the URL would be more distracting to driver of the car behind? And it's not like it is exactly easy to aim your phone camera to and read the QR code on a flying banner from the car in front of you, in addition to using smartphone mean traffic law violation. And text in URL also spoiler the link content a bit to invite interest. 172.70.49.196 02:45, 25 May 2021 (UTC)
QR codes for urls are more a marketing ploy. The usage for typing urls into a webbrowser can be as easily done by an OCR algorithm on the camera image. Sebastian --172.68.110.118 12:02, 25 May 2021 (UTC)
Plain text (if it contains interesting words) will catch the driver's attention. QR codes are easy to ignore.
It looks like "List of Fictional Colors" used to exist but was deleted late July 2020 172.69.33.119 04:11, 25 May 2021 (UTC)
I have nothing useful to add but wanted to point out that "as easily distracted as me." is grammatically incorrect - it should instead be "as easily distracted as I." 172.70.100.54 13:25, 25 May 2021 (UTC)
XKCD 1576 OhFFS (talk) 14:53, 26 May 2021 (UTC)
Firstly, no native speaker of English says "as [whatever] as I". Secondly, the whole phrase, "someone as easily distracted as me", not just "someone", is governed by the preposition "by". See ¬ß8 of the article on "as" in H.W. Fowler's A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (1926) for case after "as". 198.41.238.107 21:01, 1 January 2022 (UTC)
Without referencing Fowler's thoughts, I would suggest "...someone as easily distracted as I am." would work. In fact, I'd prefer it. (But there might be a US/UK divide, or similar dichotomy. Like choosing to answer "Do you have <a thing>?" with either "Yes I do." or "Yes I have.") 172.70.162.147 23:13, 1 January 2022 (UTC)
In a quick sample of everyone sitting at my computer at the moment, 100% of native speakers of English say "as [whatever] as I". And the fact that the phrase "someone as easily distracted as [me|I]" is introduced with a preposition doesn't affect the internal composition of the phrase. Jkshapiro (talk) 14:54, 15 May 2022 (UTC)
The wikipedia list should have a warning before it due to a HIGH nerd sniping potential. No doubt that was the intent. --Hman
It's a legitimate technique. I've been trying to read this explanation page for 48 hours but it keeps sending me down a Wikipedia hole that I have to dig myself out of. Xseo (talk) 10:14, 26 May 2021 (UTC)

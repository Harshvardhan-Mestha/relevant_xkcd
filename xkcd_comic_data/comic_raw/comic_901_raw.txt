Temperature

Title text: And the baby has a fever.
Explanation[edit]
This is a play on the fact that many digital thermometers look similar to pregnancy tests. Cueball, perhaps feeling ill, thinks he is using a thermometer to measure his body temperature and determine if he has a fever. As a male, and as he is taking it orally, he is doubtless surprised when the thermometer tells him instead that he is pregnant.
The two bars on the thermometer are similar to lines that appear on a traditional pregnancy test. One bar is the control line; it will become visible given any normal urine sample. If it doesn't appear, the test is invalid. The other bar, the test line, reacts to human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone that's released during pregnancy. If both lines become visible, the test result is positive; if only the control line becomes visible, the test result is negative. Other results are invalid, since the control line didn't appear.
Thermometers are typically used to measure temperature, and the title text notes that this clever thermometer has also detected a fever in the baby.

Apparently, male pregnancy is a thing. It requires surgery and artificial implantation, but it's a legitimate thing that yields live babies. Davidy²²[talk] 02:00, 17 April 2013 (UTC)
Link? That's really difficult to believe. Theo (talk) 18:13, 22 August 2013 (UTC)

That movie is fiction. Where is the reference to the actual fact? FlavianusEP (talk) 16:31, 23 October 2022 (UTC)
Just a bit of trivia: there's a photo online of a pregnancy test where the control line is not (or faintly) visible and the test line is very visible. Someone said that it can happen if there was so much of that hormone that the test line drained ink from the control line. 173.245.48.24 04:10, 1 April 2014 (UTC)
If that happened you'd probably try again on a new test, possibly a different brand. If it kept happening it would probably want to see a doctor because something's going on there... -Pennpenn 108.162.250.162 01:52, 14 January 2016 (UTC)
18 days of elevated basal body temperature are a sign of pregnancy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_body_temperature, no source given there, but I’ve read this somewhere else™ before). 162.158.94.224 09:03, 6 September 2020 (UTC)
What if the pregnancy tests didn’t tell him he was pregnant, it just was already used? SilverTheTerribleMathematician (talk) 05:30, 10 December 2022 (UTC)

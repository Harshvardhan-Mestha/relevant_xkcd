Profile Creation Flowchart

Title text: This one goes out to xxCrazyPixie1987xx
Explanation[edit]
AIM (short for AOL Instant Messenger, now defunct) offered its users profile pages to share info about themselves or their friends. Randall notes that these pages fall into one of three categories:
People without friends or significant others who linked to their LiveJournal (a blogging service popular in the early 2000s);
People with friends and significant others who would celebrate their relationship all over their page;
People with friends who would fill their profile with inside jokes only their friends could understand.
Both AIM and LiveJournal were known for their teenage user base, as shown by the title text's fictional AIM screen name.
The title text seems to reference the kind of behavior someone with a tribute page would display, but is actually an example of an inside joke, for cartoonists. The text comes from Natalie Dee Comic 956, from January 8, 2006, a few months before this xkcd comic was published on April 26 of the same year.

Discussion
The Natalie Dee comic 956 is titled (or labelled) "this one goes out to xxcrazypixie1987xx", i.e. (apart from case) exactly the title text of this comic. Dee was published some months after xkcd (August 2006 instead of April 2006), but if the date stamp in the URL is correct still a few days before xkcd's 143: Parody Week: TFD and Natalie Dee was published. Not sure if this is common Natalie Dee folklore or if it's worth mentioning in the explanation here (and maybe also at #143, then). --YMS (talk) 14:27, 18 December 2017 (UTC)

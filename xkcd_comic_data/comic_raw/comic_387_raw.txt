Advanced Technology

Title text: We are sexy, sexy Von Neumann machines.
Explanation[edit]
Cueball is fascinated by Megan's uterus—because it can create a copy of herself (albeit not an identical copy). Despite how advanced technology is, humans still have not been able to create a machine that replicates itself, an accomplishment to which only biological organisms can lay a claim.
The title text refers to a Von Neumann machine, what is usually called "Von Neumann probe" or "Self replicating machine," a machine that would be capable of building a fully functional copy of itself. It just takes sex involving two individuals of a different sex to start the human replication factory.
Transcript[edit]
[Cueball is inspecting Megan's abdomen.]
Cueball: It's neat how you contain a factory for making more of you.

It seems to me that Cueball is examining Megan's abdomen (where her uterus, the "factory" itself, is contained), rather than her crotch as stated by the Explain XKCD description. It's not just the logic, but also the shape of Cueball's head (which may just be an artifact of the drawing process). Does anyone agree, or is it probably just me?

It's there in the official transcript.117.194.199.173 15:08, 11 February 2013 (UTC)
Still seems kind of, i don't know, incorrect. The crotch is the factory door, not the factory. 108.162.219.58 18:18, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
Hmmm, self-replicating Von Neumann machines are more like parthenogenic aphids (asexual or "clones") rather than human sexual reproduction... Meg would not be able to copy herself. Apart from that, I like this cartoon as it does point out how fantastic reproduction really is. Oh, and Cueball 'should' be looking at her abdomen rather than her crotch methinks Squirreltape (talk) 16:13, 13 February 2014 (UTC)

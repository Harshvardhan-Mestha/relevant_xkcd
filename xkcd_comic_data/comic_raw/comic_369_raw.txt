Dangers

Title text: Zero results: 'snake charming' and 'haberdashery'. (Things like 'car' and 'boating' and such are of course the highest, by a huge margin.)
Explanation[edit]
This comic is a chart of the frequency of certain phrases in Google search results, based on the format "died in a ______ accident." At the time of this comic, if you enclosed search terms in quotation marks, Google looked up the exact phrase rather than the individual words in any order.
"Died in a blogging accident" was very rare in Google until this comic appeared. It could be found on over 10,000 webpages approximately 12 hours after the comic was posted. Similarly, both snake charming and haberdashery accidents also return hundreds of Google results.

Google now has 687000 results for "Died in a blogging accident", "can be found on over 10000 web pages" doesn't reflect that, but I wouldn't know which number to use for an edit :) 141.101.92.9 00:28, 8 September 2015 (UTC)
I highly doubt the gardening search had anything to do with Spinal Tap. Gardening accidents are common. -- Flewk (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
According to some sleuths on StackExchange, it sadly seems the original "died in a blogging accident" posts no longer exist, as they were posts from a Myspace that is now gone. 172.68.141.190 09:06, 27 February 2020 (UTC)
There aren't any results for 'died in a knitting accident' before Jan 11, 2008. I wonder if there's a similar situation there?

When I attempted to find the two results for blogging accidents, I didn't use the date query feature, and instead narrowed it down by deleting search terms that came up that were usually signs of being influenced by the xkcd comic. However, with this search query: "died in a blogging accident" -xkcd -randall -instagram -chexquest -knitting
on page four, you get two results from the steelguitarforum: https://bb.steelguitarforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=36877&view=next (from 2001) https://bb.steelguitarforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=881412&sid=2668da1dbca46c81ce7f6fd2b7b8b620 (from 2007) So, unless these dates were changed after the fact, this implies that these two search results were what Randall got. Unfortunately, these aren't people, instead they're a beer brand and a hard drive, respectively. 162.158.75.160 20:13, 22 October 2020 (UTC)

40: Light
Explain xkcd: It's 'cause you're dumb.

Light

Title text: Like a beacon
Explanation[edit]
Lighthouses were built on coasts to give ships a point of reference where land was, so that they could find where they were going, and to know where they should avoid during a storm. Megan fills this role for Cueball. She is his lighthouse to know where he can be safe.
This also has a romantic notion, as Megan is lighting up the world for Cueball to find her.
Transcript[edit]
[A crowd of figures stand around in the dark. A Megan is illuminated by a beam of light.]
In a dark and confusing world,
you burn brightly
I never feel lost

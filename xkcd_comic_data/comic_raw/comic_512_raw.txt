Alternate Currency

Title text: For the first time ever, the phrase 'I'd like to thank everyone at 4chan for making me successful and happy' is uttered.
Explanation[edit]
Cueball is shown watching television, where it is announced that the US dollar has collapsed and been replaced by an 'alternative currency' of humorous pictures commonly shared on the internet (an Internet Meme). Such a currency would be utterly useless; for untraceable and easily counterfeited .gif and .jpeg files to become more monetarily stable than the US dollar would mean that the economy is all kinds of screwed, to the point of utter absurdity.
The title text pokes fun at users of 4Chan who are notoriously known for their habit of hoarding image macros, a practice he suggests is almost useless except in the instance jokingly suggested by the comic. 4Chan is also reputable for reducing the Happiness and Success of many people their community targets anonymously. Randall also pokes fun at himself in saying, "I have been preparing for this moment my whole life," indirectly implying he is also guilty of this practice.
The "rare pepe" meme that has recently sprouted on 4chan implies that some photoshopped pictures of Pepe the frog are valuable and that they could be sold. 120 Rare pepe's reached a price of $99,166 on eBay before being removed as seen here.
With the rise of cryptocurrency and NFTs, this absurdist comic is becoming indistinguishable from reality.
Transcript[edit]

I predict that Bitcoin will be succeeded by this 108.162.241.114 01:24, 14 February 2014 (UTC)
This could be an even deeper jab at Bitcoin. The principle of Bitcoin is that information equals value. (Oversimplified, I know)
Now, I think Cueball says that even funnies and image macros are more valuable currency because each one has an inherent value - most are mildly entertaining. That's not a whole lot of inherent value, but at least, it's a nonzero amount. 141.101.104.70 10:56, 4 December 2014 (UTC)

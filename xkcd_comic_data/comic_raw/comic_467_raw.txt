X Girls Y Cups

Title text: Also no results: 1girl10000cups, 2girls(5+3i)cups, 65536girls65536cups, or 3frenchhens2turtledoves1cup.
Explanation[edit]
The comic refers to Hungry Bitches, a 2007 scat-fetish pornographic film. The one-minute preview, unofficially nicknamed "2 Girls 1 Cup," is a viral video that became a well-known internet meme. It is therefore not surprising that only the input combination of x=2 and y=1 generates a significant number of search results, being 257 times as frequent as the runner-up, "1 Girl 1 Cup."
This table is an example of a rudimentary heat map. The cells in the table with zero hits are white. From 1 to 9 they are yellow, and above that they are orange - except the maximum, which is red. As the second largest count is below 10,000 (7503) and the maximum almost two million, it is impossible to say if the red color is reserved for the maximum or for any number above a given value, say from ten thousand or up to above a million hits.
The title text suggests other combinations like 1 girl to 10,000 cups (very large number of cups to one girl), 2 girls to (5+3i) cups (a complex number), 65536 girls to 65536 cups (216, the first integer that can't be represented as a two-byte unsigned integer), and finally 3 French hens and 2 turtle doves to 1 cup. All are phrases with apparently no search results.
The last phrase is a reference to the song The Twelve Days of Christmas. After the publication of this comic, the phrase has been cross-posted at various sites in order to generate search results and prove the statement in the title text wrong. The same has happened to other entries, as it often happens shortly after Randall posts something regarding Google searches.

This page is in the category Sex. I don't see anything about that topic here. Can someone explain? Matchups (talk) 14:49, 24 June 2013 (UTC)
If you don't see the connection between this and sex, you are one of the fortunate ones. Do not google it. There's not enough brain bleach in a swimming pool.
As mentioned here and in the Wikipedia article, 2 Girls 1 Cup is a trailer for a scat-fetish film, and it is at least intended to cause sexual arousal "if you like that sort of thing". Of course, not many people do. Mark Hurd (talk) 16:40, 24 June 2013 (UTC)
There are now 38 million google hits for 5 girls 6 cups. Someone should update the graphic. 199.27.128.141 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
IIRC unsigned short is *at least* 16 bits 108.162.215.120 04:46, 18 August 2014 (UTC)
I know it's utterly trivial, but I have to say it, so here goes: This is an English language wiki. No matter what your accent, it's thousands commas and decimal points, not the other way around. Thank you. Anonymous 20:59, 9 December 2014 (UTC)
PS: how did the white-on-black system used by many, if not most, if not all, non-English speakers come about? It just doesn't make intuitive sense to me. 173.245.49.121 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
Well, here goes my response: Pretty much only the U.S. and U.K. uses commas. It’s an America/UK thing, not an English thing. Technically, it’s an imperial thing, and 0,5 would be metric, but semantics. Netherin5 (talk) 14:00, 11 March 2019 (UTC)
But Australia (and I'm assuming NZ) is a fully metric country that uses dots for decimals. I cannot think of an English-speaking country that uses commas, that's pretty much a European thing. 172.69.135.92 03:34, 17 September 2020 (UTC)
Here in South Africa we use the decimal comma. -- The Cat Lady (talk) 10:12, 15 August 2021 (UTC)
Did anyone else see the title and hope "Y cups" would turn out to be a bra size? Promethean (talk) 14:16, 11 August 2017 (UTC)
x is left-right and y up-down. just saying. --141.101.98.184 13:05, 28 March 2019 (UTC)
Amusing side note: as of today, "7 girls 7 cups" has 7 results.  :-) 172.71.151.40 (talk) 19:51, 30 November 2022 (please sign your comments with ~~~~)

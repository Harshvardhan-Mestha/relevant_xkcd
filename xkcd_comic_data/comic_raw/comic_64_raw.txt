Solar Plexus

Title text: It hurts to be hit there, you know
Explanation[edit]
The solar plexus is a network of interconnecting nerves that is centered in the area of the abdomen near the stomach. A blow to this area is painful and the cause of the feeling called "getting the wind knocked out of you" and is prevalent in media.
The trick "A sphincter says what" is a juvenile taunt that tricks a person into calling themselves a sphincter when they respond, "what?"
Black Hat resolves the solar plexus joke with a punch to Cueball in the solar plexus as opposed to a normal punch(line).
The title text mentions truthfully that it hurts to be hit there.
Transcript[edit]

Discussion
This comic is unique (or, if not unique, certainly uncommon) in the continuity of XKCD in that it relies purely on physical humor of a sort that usually belongs to more lowbrow comics, TV shows or movies. Most of XKCD's humor is based on cleverness, curiosity, social frustrations or quirks, or analysis of our world – comparatively "intellectual" humor. In this comic, none of that is present; instead, the only "joke" centers around Cueball being physically assaulted. Interesting. 71.201.53.130 14:32, 13 September 2013 (UTC)
Well there is 677 "Green Flash", in which the only "joke" centers around the idea of Black Hat knocking Cueball unconscious so he can steal his car. And I believe there are any number of comics where one of the protagonists is pummeled or otherwise harmed, either on or off panel, with the intent that we laugh at it. I believe there is a continuum of such humor in xkcd, along with all the "intellectual" humor as well. I don't think this one is interesting on that particular basis. 108.162.219.58 01:48, 1 February 2014 (UTC)
No no, 677 is the one where Beret Guy gets a backhoe and hits Cueball and Megan with the digger. I think you're referring to 766. 0100011101100001011011010110010101011010011011110110111001100101 (talk page) 20:56, 12 February 2014 (UTC)
I might be a year late, but might I point you in the direction of 1318, 0100011101100001011011010110010101000010011011110110111001100101.

Why would you? It has nothing to do with this one. Fabian42 (talk) 11:11, 8 June 2018 (UTC)
I don't think blackhat is at a loss to finish the joke. Based on his personality, the punchline to the solar plexus joke was literally a punch to the solar plexus. -- Flewk (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~) This might be a reference to Wayne's World with "a sphincter says what"
I still don't "get" the joke. I don't think the explanation here is adequate! 162.158.94.104 21:50, 8 May 2021 (UTC)
I always thought a solar plexus was an astronomical phenonemon related to the sun

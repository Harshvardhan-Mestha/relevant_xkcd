Getting Out of Hand

Title text: Wikipedia's role as brain-extension, while a little troubling, is also really cool.
Explanation[edit]
Given how Wikipedia has an ever-expanding variety of topics, the grand majority of them in great detail, there is a possibility (even a temptation) of relying on Wikipedia to learn from every topic that leaves you confused... even foreplay. ('Bedtime' and 'us time' are not necessarily 'computer time'.)
This comic may also be a reference to how people can get addicted to reading Wikipedia pages, because there are many interesting links on each page that people haven't read yet, and there are links on that page that they click on, etc.
The title text refers to the fact that many rely on Wikipedia instead of remembering/learning stuff. Reliance on Wikipedia was later directly addressed as the subject of 903: Extended Mind.
Transcript[edit]
[A couple is in bed in the dark, and Cueball reaches out from under the covers to do a Wikipedia search about Foreplay.]

Discussion
The headline "Getting Out of Hand" appears to be a double entendre when the word "hand" is taken literally. Mountain Hikes (talk) 17:18, 6 October 2015 (UTC)

Green Flash

Title text: The exact cause of the phenomenon is unknown, but it's thought to be linked to atmospheric refraction and you getting a really cool car.
Explanation[edit]
Green flash refers to an optical phenomenon which occurs at twilight (early dawn or late dusk), where a flash of green light can be seen at the very edge of the sun. Black Hat attempts to distract Cueball with this event so that he may knock out Cueball with the bottle in his hand and steal his new car, a Tesla Roadster. If the bottle is green, it would also be the cause of the green flash.
The title text simply continues this, wherein Black Hat jokes that Green Flashes are actually caused, at least in part, by the fact that he has a cool car worth stealing.
Transcript[edit]
[Black Hat and Cueball are standing on the beach, watching the sun set. Black Hat is holding something in his left hand.]
Black Hat: Did you know that if you stare at the sun just as it sets, you can see a green flash?
Black Hat: And feel a sharp blow to the head, and hear the faint hum of me driving away in your new Tesla Roadster?

I think this also quotes : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Ray_(film)

You can enter a wiki link like this: {{w|The Green Ray (film)}} which gives The Green Ray (film).--Dgbrt (talk) 12:20, 3 December 2013 (UTC)
It's https in January 2015. But both links work (to the former.) -- Weatherlawyer (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
Might a green flash to knock someone out, in combination with a blow to the head, might be a Harry Potter reference? --198.41.242.64 21:08, 6 January 2017 (UTC)

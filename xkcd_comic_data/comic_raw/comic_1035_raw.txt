Cadbury Eggs

Title text: When they moved production from New Zealand to the UK and switched from the runny white centers to the thick, frosting-like filling, it got way harder to cook them scrambled.
Explanation[edit]
Cadbury Eggs are a chocolate egg-shaped candy with a filling. They are supposed to replicate a real egg with a hard exterior and soft interior. However, unlike real eggs, the exterior is edible.[citation needed]
In this comic, Cueball is trying to say that sodas have way too much sugar to even be appealing as beverages, because they contain as much sugar as 2 or 3 Cadbury Eggs, and one Cadbury Egg alone makes him feel gross. (A 12 oz can equals 355 mL, while a 20 oz bottle is about 590 mL.)
However, Megan interprets this in precisely the opposite way to what Cueball intended. Instead of comparing soda to Cadbury Eggs, she compares Cadbury Eggs to soda. If a few Cadbury Eggs have the same amount of sugar as soda, Megan can eat as many as she wants year-round in place of soda, with no additional guilt. Cadbury Eggs are usually consumed around Easter — which is anywhere between March 22nd and May 7th, depending on whether one is consulting the Catholic or Orthodox calendar.
The title text mentions the closure of the manufacture in New Zealand in 2009 and the change of the filling from runny to thick as a consequence. The joke here is the comparison to real eggs, which can be cooked scrambled, the new thick filling is not liquid enough to be cooked in a pan, as was the old runny filling.
Transcript[edit]
[Two Cadbury eggs, one in the foil, the other out of the foil and broken open to reveal the gooey center.]
A Cadbury egg has about 20g of sugar. (25g outside the US.) "One Cadbury Egg" is a nice unit of sugar content.
[A can of soda with an equals sign and two eggs; a bottle of soda with an equals sign and three eggs.]
One 12oz. can of soda has about two Cadbury eggs worth of sugar. One 20oz. bottle has three.
[Two unwrapped Cadbury eggs, with an arrow indicating they should be placed in a glass of water.]
One Cadbury egg is enough to make me feel kinda gross. Now when I see Coke or Snapple or Nestea or whatever, I imagine drinking a couple of dissolved Cadbury eggs.
[Megan puts her hand to her chin in thought, Cueball has his arms out in exclamation.]
Megan: Wow. Huh. So the takeaway is... I can eat Cadbury eggs by the handful all season and feel no worse about it than I do about soda?
Cueball: That's not really—
Megan: This is awesome!
Cueball: *sigh*
Trivia[edit]
Cadbury Eggs and the high sugar content of soda are referenced again in 1793: Soda Sugar Comparisons.
The Cadbury egg/soda comparison is also mentioned in the what if? Soda Planet.

They can't *all* be like that. I'm pretty sure the ones with caramel fillings have waay more calories than the average egg, and coke zero probably amounts to less than one egg. Davidy22[talk] 08:34, 21 January 2013 (UTC)
true, but it's worse for you for completely different reasons. Xseo (talk) 10:07, 15 April 2013 (UTC)
surely coke zero isn't technically food. why not replace it with hummingbird urine? naturally sweet! 108.162.219.223 01:33, 22 January 2014 (UTC)
Out of sheer intellectual curiosity do humming birds urinate? 162.158.152.5 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
Re: Intellectual curiosity -- No. The white stuff on bird poop is eurine.
Packaging colours, filling colour, and title-text indicate that it's about the cream eggs, not caramel. Is it more common in America to call them Cadbury eggs and not cream eggs? Seems weird to this Brit, Cadbury's is the brand, they do more than just eggs, and we typically say Cadbury's with the possessive apostrophe-s. Also of note is the year-round thing. Cream eggs are sold year-round, but are stocked in higher quantities over Easter (and green-yolked ones for Halloween), but their advertising campaign here tends to suggest that they are available exclusively in those two seasons (worse, Halloween is actually very rare to see in televised advertising, as by then the larger shops are decorated for Christmas. I don't recall ever seeing Halloween egg adverts, somebody scour YouTube?)141.101.99.130 01:56, 6 March 2014 (UTC)
Unfortunately, unlike in Britain, the cream eggs are all that can be found in the US from Cadbury. So naturally they became "the" Cadbury product. Some import stores have chocolate bars, but they're hard to find. And in either case they're actually manufactured by Hershey under license (although they're still better than normal Hershey chocolate). And for the most part, while they can easily be found here year-round, in Easter most stores will put them by the registers and in general this is the only time they're really brought to social awareness. Also, I've found that, at least in American English, whether we use the possessive for brand names is entirely dependent on the brand (and rather random in my opinion), but both tend to sound right. 199.27.133.75 01:48, 6 January 2015 (UTC)
A bit late, but… a few years ago, the UK branding changed from "Cadbury's Creme Egg" to "Cadbury Creme Egg". Virtually nobody noticed. And somehow I feel the compulsion to point out the common misspelling. There were also some displays in discount shops that had "Cadbury Eggs"; possibly manufacturing overrun for international markets or something. I think most people would know what you mean, because their other egg-shaped products (with the exception of easter eggs) are branded as "Caramel Egg" or similar without the big Cadbury logo. - 141.101.98.94 14:16, 7 August 2017 (UTC)
Anyone saw snapple? It is a reference to a previous "Snapple" xkcd comic and I believe it is worth noting 173.245.48.212 09:14, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
It's also the name of a drink in the US. It's probably a coincidence.-Pennpenn 108.162.250.162 01:03, 2 October 2015 (UTC)
They have Cadbury's products over there despite the sewer pipe issue issue? I used Google News BEFORE it was clickbait (talk) 22:53, 21 January 2015 (UTC)
You might want to clarify the issue you're talking about, Shrapnel. -Pennpenn 108.162.250.162 01:03, 2 October 2015 (UTC)
Eggshells are edible albeit not tasty. --141.101.95.13 01:43, 13 June 2016 (UTC)
I'm concerned where you got that information from; I do hope you didn't actually try one after (or before, for that matter) reading this comic... --Char Latte49 (talk) 17:18, 11 March 2021 (UTC)

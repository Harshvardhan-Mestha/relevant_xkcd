Macgyver Gets Lazy

Title text: At the time of this writing, Wikipedia has a wonderful article titled 'List of problems solved by Macgyver'
Explanation[edit]
MacGyver was an '80s and early '90s TV character, famed for improvising complex devices in a matter of minutes in order to escape dangerous situations. In this comic, MacGyver suggests an unusually direct plan—shooting the guard in the head. However, he still manages to describe his plan in a rather 'complex' manner.
It is worth noting that in the show, MacGyver was adamantly against the use of guns and never used one (at least, not for its intended purpose) in the entire run of the old series.
A MacGyver reboot was made in 2016 and was not well received (38% on Metacritic, 4.6/10 in iMDb). Despite this negative reception, the series began its fifth season in December 2020.
The Wikipedia page referenced by the title text redirects to the main MacGyver entry since September 2012. The Wikipedia page can still be found in history, and the content has been moved to MacGyver wikia and expanded. As of now, the page redirects to MacGyver (1985 TV series).
Transcript[edit]
[Outside of a building with a door marked No Entry and a guard standing outside, Cueball and MacGyver are hiding.]
Cueball: Any ideas?
MacGyver: I can use the trigger mechanism of this gun to ignite a small explosive charge, propelling a metal slug into the guard's head.

The wikipedia article mentioned in the comic no longer exists, but an old version of it is still viewable here: List of problems solved by MacGyver 75.186.140.173 23:39, 18 April 2013 (UTC)
The explanation: "MacGyver was adamantly against the use of guns and never used one (at least, not for its intended purpose) in the entire run of the series." Is wrong. In the pilot episode, MacGyver rescues a downed pilot from hostile soldiers. He first uses a captured gun as a distraction, then another one to actually fire at approaching soldiers (As is required at the time, but he hands the gun off to the wounded man as fast as possible, showing his dislike for them. He also does not use the gun for the intended purpose (To kill), but blind fires at the ground to stop the guards and force them to take cover.) 173.245.56.210 16:36, 1 April 2015 (UTC)
And there is no mention of murdoc...141.101.105.205
The 2016 version, starring Lucas Till is also fun. It's particularly good because it shows Mac with a team of friends instead of being a loner. Jelsemium (talk) 23:29, 13 December 2017 (UTC) Jelsemium.

Pet Peeve #114

Title text: I'm reading a goddamn book, thank you very much.
Explanation[edit]
A pet peeve is a minor annoyance that an individual identifies as particularly annoying to them, to a greater degree than others may find it. Cueball counts his pet peeves; this is number 114.
Cueball's friend calls him and finds out that he is reading a book on a Saturday night. Saturday night, or the weekend in general, is supposed to be a time for enjoying or partying with friends after five weekdays of work. But Cueball is annoyed by the fact that people are stuck with the stereotype of partying out on weekends. In his view, reading a good book is also a great way of enjoying the weekend. His annoyance is expressed in the title text.
This was the first time Randall mentions his many Pet Peeves. Although the next already appeared in 283: Projection four months later, still in 2007, it is a slow growing list, but one has been added roughly every other year since then, the fifth coming towards the end of 2018 in 2080: Cohort and Age Effects.

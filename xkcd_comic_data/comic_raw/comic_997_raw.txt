Wait Wait

Title text: You can't stab Carl Kasell. He sounds all slow and stentorian, but he moves like a snake.
Explanation[edit]
Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me is an hour-long weekly radio news panel game show produced by Chicago Public Radio and National Public Radio. The show is hosted by playwright and actor Peter Sagal. Each episode ends with the panelists making up a potential future news story, usually with implausible "facts". This comic is making puns on the title of the show based on what Peter Sagal might have done that was newsworthy.
Carl Kasell, who also served as the news anchor on Morning Edition, was the show's official judge and scorekeeper until May 2014 (after this comic was published), when he retired and was replaced by Bill Kurtis.
The 1st row, 4th paper may refer to the Laugh Factory Incident of 2006.
In the 3rd row, first paper, Lakshmi Singh is NPR's national midday newscaster. This paper leads to the second paper on the third row, in which Sagal's wife divorces him over his affair with Singh.
In the 3rd row, 3rd paper is a reference to a protest at UC Davis (on the campus of University of California, Davis) protests in early 2012 in which sitting, peaceful protesters were calmly pepper-sprayed in their faces by a police officer. That spawned an internet meme of epic proportions.
In the 4th row, 2nd paper is a reference to the movie, Ghostbusters.
In the 4th row, 3rd paper is a reference to Granny Weatherwax of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels; Granny Weatherwax is a witch who carries a sign saying "I ATEN'T DED"(sic) when having out-of-body experiences.
In the 5th row, 2nd paper is a reference to another internet meme in where someone leaves out the verb in the sentence. The implication is that the verb is something bad, but which bad thing is left as an exercise to stew in the reader's mind. See the I Accidentally ___ meme for more information.
In the 5th row, 3rd paper is a reference to the Eldritch abomination Cthulhu, from "The Call of Cthulhu" by H.P. Lovecraft. He is one of the Old Ones, the Elder Gods, and is awakened by his worshipers chanting, "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn" ("In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.") Hence the title, "Wait, Wait, Don't speak its name."
Two years later another New Years comic, 1311: 2014, took a similar look at what could happen in 2014, just as this does for 2012. Interesting enough the title of that comic (just the year it was looking at) is more related to the title of the next comic after this one, which is also a New Year comic, and the title is also just the number of the year: 998: 2012.

The 5th Row, 3rd paper, "Wait Wait ... don't speak its name" may refer to the Lovecraftian Eldetr God Hastur, also known as "He Who is Not to be Named." Eldritch was a favorite Lovecraft word used extensively in the Cthulhu Mythos. 74.120.13.132 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
Row three, column three should be "Wait wait, dont taze me, bro" 173.245.63.146 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
Is there a real kneed for this: (sic) in stories about Granny Weatherwax? I used Google News BEFORE it was clickbait (talk) 06:42, 22 January 2015 (UTC)
I guess it is impossible to find "may refer to" for all 20 headlines? because this comic pretends to be "fixed" thus not all have an explanation. -- 108.162.254.18 08:25, 4 February 2015 (UTC)
"Don't Dissect Me" reminds me of a Stephen King short story, Autopsy Room Four, from the collection Everything's Eventual. Boct1584 (talk) 14:47, 1 April 2015 (UTC)
Can we have a table for this? 108.162.245.40 22:44, 30 November 2016 (UTC)
I think that the first one implies that he is the hostage, not the gunman. Anyone else think so? 172.68.174.64 16:48, 17 January 2019 (UTC)
Yeah, I agree, Sagal's the hostage.172.68.65.150 00:46, 21 August 2019 (UTC)
Anyone else feels that this explanation would deserve an incomplete tag? --Lupo (talk) 10:50, 18 December 2019 (UTC)
Could row 5 panel 2 be referencing the "You'll Be OK" comic (https://pbfcomics.com/comics/youll-be-ok/) by the Perry Bible Fellowship, which is one of the linked comic sites at the bottom of the xkcd page? Because the sub-heading coule read "Peter Sagal accidetanlly *OK*", if you read across to the little picture. 108.162.250.127 04:31, 21 January 2020 (UTC) Hadley
Row 3, panel 5 "cash-for-tote-bags" is almost certainly a reference to a classic Bloom County comic strip story arc in which the corrupt Senator Bedfellow is arrested for trading in black market "Bill the Cat" tote bags. I couldn't find a copy of that strip online, but it's referenced in this Bloom County wiki entry, including a picture very similar to these of a newspaper headline comic panel: https://bloomcounty.fandom.com/wiki/Senator_Bedfellow 162.158.154.151 15:43, 25 March 2023 (UTC)

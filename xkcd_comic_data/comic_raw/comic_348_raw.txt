Close to You

Title text: We should probably talk about this before the wedding.
Explanation[edit]
This is Randall's version of the popular Carpenters song, "(They Long to Be) Close to You." The actual first verse goes like this:
Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
In this parody, the reason birds suddenly appear whenever the girl is near is because the girl is a zombie, and those are turkey vultures, carrion birds that prey on the flesh of dead bodies.
The title text is joking about couples not discussing their relationship before their wedding, as is seen here.
Transcript[edit]
[Cueball is singing to Megan, who has wiggly lines and unkempt hair. Musical notes appear around Cueball's words.]
Cueball: Why do birds suddenly appear
[Still singing.]
Cueball: Every tiiiime you are neeear
[Cueball stops singing. He looks up.]
Cueball: Wait, are those turkey vultures?
[Cueball turns to Megan.]
Cueball: Okay, listen, are you a zombie?
Megan: Hurrghhh...

Don't think that's Danish - limbs are all squiggly, hair is different... Perhaps just unnamed zombie girl? MR (talk) 22:58, 1 March 2013 (UTC)MR
You're probably right. It was my best guess. (Of course, the squiggly lines could be explained as being par for zombies). Ekedolphin (talk) 04:05, 12 March 2013 (UTC)
Never thought xkcd would make a Carpenters reference. This comic really has everything 162.158.106.228 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)

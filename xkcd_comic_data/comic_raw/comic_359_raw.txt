Rock Band

Title text: I'm gonna have to add something to the strum bar so it makes a clicky sound like the old controllers. I'm so used to the feedback; the silence throws me off.
Explanation[edit]
A smug Cueball demeans his friends' fun experience on Rock Band, a video game which allows players to simulate playing real songs, as if in a real band. The oblivious "band" keeps rocking out, and it transpires that his real purpose is not to spread knowledge but to ruin others' fun (to no avail, thankfully).
The title text is a comment on haptic feedback, comparing the guitar controllers of Guitar Hero, which make a clicking sound when the user strums, with those of Rock Band, which do not click.
Transcript[edit]
[Three people are playing Rock Band, one on guitar, another on drums, and the last on vocals. Music notes float above them. Cueball with arms crossed is looking at them.]
Cueball: You know, playing this doesn't make you cool like a real rock band.
Cueball: Guys?
Cueball: Didn't you hear me?
Cueball: Stop having fun!

As I see it, cueball is accusing the others of playing music like this in order to look cool, like a real rock band, The others ignore him because they are doing it to have fun, not to look cool. 108.162.241.123 20:49, 3 October 2016 (UTC) Woooo, a trope namer!

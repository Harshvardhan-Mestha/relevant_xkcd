Home Organization

Title text: Lifehacking!
Explanation[edit]
This comic is a take on the typical "how to" which details "how to" organize your home. In many cases, finding the best organization can be difficult and/or can take a long time. To skip this problem, Cueball "Just Gives Up" and puts all his items and furniture into a box labeled "Misc" for miscellaneous, with the exception of his laptop, cable modem and router.
The title text is a take on the popular website Lifehacker which includes all sorts of posts on how to "hack" your life and improve it. Life hacking appears to be a common theme in xkcd, such as in 2024: Light Hacks.
Transcript[edit]
[One big plain room with a person sitting on the floor with a laptop on one side, a modem and wireless router on the other, and a big box full of the usual accoutrements of living in the middle, with "MISC" written on the side.]
Home Organization Tip: Just Give Up.

Seeing as how the lamp is in the box and no lighting is on the ceiling, one would suspect the room to be quite dark, illuminated only be the laptop screen and the modem lights. (please sign your posts) -Don't forget the router lights. Xyz (talk) 12:50, 3 June 2013 (UTC)
The observer sees the scene through the open window which also lets the light in. Jiří Dobrý (talk) 21:01, 13 September 2013 (UTC)
I didn't see that. (No frames.) It's how to live your life if you are Robin Hood or one of the gang. All you need is in the hose: a bed and fire as opposed to a laptop and modem. Everything else is outside (thinking outside the box.) I used Google News BEFORE it was clickbait (talk) 18:19, 21 January 2015 (UTC)
The box full of stuff would interfere with the wifi signal. Cueball should move the box onto the roof. Mikemk (talk) 23:00, 26 February 2015 (UTC)--DrMath 05:13, 3 April 2015 (UTC)
Don't you need a Roomba as well? Catnerd8695 (talk) 22:03, 24 May 2018 (UTC)
I'm in this picture and I don't like it. Singlelinelabyrinth (talk) 02:44, 26 July 2020 (UTC)

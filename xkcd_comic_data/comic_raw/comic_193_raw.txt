The Perfect Sound

Title text: Oh, what a pity, can't you understand...
Explanation[edit]
This comic relates to the song "Mickey", performed in 1982 by one-hit-wonder Toni Basil. The lyrics, as well as the instrumentation of the song, were in fact rather simple, being a perfect example of bubblegum pop in the early 1980s.
In the comic, however, the song is introduced as a musical masterpiece. Cueball points out the opening sequence to his friend and states that it should be considered art. When the chorus sets in and the song unfolds its lyrical brilliancy, his friend has no other comment to make except that there must be something wrong with Cueball.
Cueball's actions might be seen as a critical approach towards over-interpreting music. The comic's title, as well as the stereo setup depicted, could perhaps also denote a sidesweep on audiophiles.
The title text parodies a line from the song and links it with the incomprehension of Cueball's friend.
Transcript[edit]
[Cueball and his friend are listening to music on a stereo.]
Cueball: I'm telling you, listen right here to the sets of rising notes following the opening section.
Friend: Uh huh.
[Cueball indicates stereo.]
Cueball: And then right here, the transition into the chorus. This is music. This is art!
[Cueball dances along with the music.]
Stereo: Oh Mickey, you so fine, you so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey! *clap* *clap* Hey Mickey!
Friend: There's something wrong with you.

Should "cueball's friend" be an indexed term? He (she?) shows up often, and i identify with him the most.173.245.56.191 00:18, 23 September 2014 (UTC)
Oddly enough, there are no notes that lead up to that opening line of the song. It's only drum beats, going, BUM-TS-BUM-BUM-TS BUM-TS-BUM-BUM-TS. The first notes of the song occur as those opening words are sung. 173.245.54.55 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
It actually says the rising notes follow the opening section not lead up to it, which is correct. 172.68.132.77 18:32, 2 August 2017 (UTC)
This actually happens to me on a regular basis. Even the most uninspired songs can sometimes have a 5-10 second sequence that I just want to listen over and over to. 162.158.89.55 18:20, 7 February 2019 (UTC)

iPhone or Droid

Title text: It may be a fundamentally empty experience, but holy crap the Droid's 265 ppi screen is amazing.
Explanation[edit]
The comic starts to set up a joke about the "phone wars" between the iPhone and phones that run the Android system (in this case the Motorola Droid), but instead just brings up a serious point criticizing the consumerism this "war" stems from. In the last line of panel 2, Cueball refers to the slogan "There's an app for that" from Apple's iPhone marketing.
Then the third panel makes a joke anyway, at Apple's expense: apparently, this "enlightenment app" was rejected from Apple's app store, which is the only supported way to put software on an iPhone. Apple has become infamous for rejecting apps from their app store without adequately explaining why. Android devices, on the other hand, are not limited to an app store and can install software from any origin. Many, however, use the Google Play Store as a primary repository for apps.
In the title text Cueball succumbs to the consumerism and marvels at the Motorola Droid's high (at the time) Pixel density. Apple responded 9 months later by releasing the iPhone 4 with a 326 ppi Retina Display. (Higher pixel densities are now standard for smartphones.)
Transcript[edit]
[Megan sitting at her computer is talking to Cueball standing behind her.]
Megan: Well, it depends what you want. The iPhone wins on speed and polish, but the Droid has that gorgeous screen and physical keyboard.
Cueball: What if I want something more than the pale facsimile of fulfillment brought by a parade of ever-fancier toys? To spend my life restlessly producing instead of sedately consuming?
Cueball: Is there an app for that?
Megan: Yeah, on both.
Megan: Wait, no, looks like it was rejected from the iPhone store.
Cueball: Droid it is, then.

What is meant by the incomplete tag? I see no reference to Linux (although it is the platform that Droid is based off of, it does not seem relevant). Kyt (talk) 02:27, 4 January 2014 (UTC)
Cueball's response is vacuous New Age-speak. That's what makes the idea that there's an "app for that" so funny. Gmcgath (talk) 07:36, 6 November 2016 (UTC)

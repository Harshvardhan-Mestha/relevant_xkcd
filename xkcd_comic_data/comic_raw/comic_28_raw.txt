Elefino

Title text: Hell if I know
Explanation[edit]
The basis for this fairly simple xkcd comic is the subject riddle, which is properly answered, as given in the title text: "Hell if I know." When spoken, this "correct" answer sounds like "elephino" ‚Äì a portmanteau of "elephant" and "rhino." This makes it again one of the early comics where Randall explains the comic via the title text.
Instead of giving the punchline of the joke, Randall answers with the unexpected "I haven't a goddamn clue," which, while having the same meaning, ruins the joke.
Transcript[edit]
Q: What do you get when you cross an Elephant with a Rhino?
[Picture of elephant, mathematical addition symbol, picture of rhino, equals sign, large question mark.]
A: I haven't a goddamn clue.

In an episode of Muppets Tonight, with Sandra Bullock as the guest star, Seymour and Pepe were telling this joke to the Muppet audience, who totally did not understand it at all. The two comedians had tried to explain the joke, but still nobody understood it.
Found it. Pepe and Seymour Elifino ... Totally worth the üêá hole. Iggynelix (talk) 15:45, 18 April 2020 (UTC)

I feel like the comparison to Back to the Future is rather pointless, so I'm going to delete it. OriginalName (talk) 04:58, 4 August 2017 (UTC)
Elefino is the name of a restaurant in the animated series Bojack Horseman. They make the same pun as this comic. I wonder if the writers of the show had read this comic a decade earlier?

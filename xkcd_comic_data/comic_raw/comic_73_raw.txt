Zeppelin

Title text: A tribute to Buttercup Festival
Explanation[edit]
A zeppelin is a type of rigid dirigible aircraft, used in the early part of the 20th century for commercial airline traffic. They were well known for being the most luxurious, comfortable air travel of the time. The Hindenburg disaster, as well as World War II, led to the end of their use as commercial airliners. Also associated with the Zeppelin name is a particular design of wristwatches,[1] notable for having the word "ZEPPELIN" (with no exclamation point) at the top of the dial, at or under where the number 12 would be. In this comic, Randall implies that, since the hour hand of the watch is pointing to the word "ZEPPELIN!," it is time for a zeppelin to appear in the sky.
The joke was continued in 288: Elevator, in which replacing a numeral with "ZEPPELIN!" also invoked the appearance of a lighter-than-air airship.
The title text refers to the webcomic Buttercup Festival, which, at the time of this comic, was defunct. It was later revived by the author then defuncted again in 2015 and revived, again, in 2019. As of 18/07/20, the comic is running its third series. It is a tribute to Buttercup festival in the way it interprets things in the world naïvely and literally to achieve humor, in a simple yet effective and uncontrived way.

Remember, if the watch is made of lead, it's Time to Watch Lead Zeppelin Para (talk)

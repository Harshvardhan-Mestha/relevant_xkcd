IN UR REALITY

Title text: Hey, at least I ran out of staples.
Explanation[edit]
The LOLcat meme genre involves pictures of cats in various poses and facial contortions accompanied by deliberately misspelled captions. Black Hat claims to be from the Internet and is thus creating LOLcat memes by literally gluing captions to Cueball's cats.
The title text suggests that Black Hat is using glue only because he ran out of staples; fortunately for the cats in the picture, glue is much less painful than a staple. The title text suggests that Black Hat was stapling captions to cats earlier. This either means that Black Hat has injured some of Cueball's cats, just not the ones on screen (which would imply that Cueball has very many cats, since Black Hat would have brought a fair number of staples to begin with) or that Black Hat injured other people's cats before going to Cueball's house in order to caption the cats there. The title is also a reference to the "I'm in ur base killing ur d00dz" catchphrase from real-time-strategy games.
Stapling things to other things has also been referenced in 291: Dignified and 478: The Staple Madness. Being "from the Internet" was spoken of in the title text of 256: Online Communities.
Transcript[edit]
[Black Hat is holding a cat and a piece of paper. Cueball has raised his arms. There are three cats with captions stuck to them.]
Black Hat: Oh hi; I'm here from the Internet.
Cueball: What are you doing!?
Black Hat: Gluing captions to your cats.
Cat: RRRR

Is "Oh Hi" a reference to O HAI, since he's from the Internet? 108.162.219.62 12:25, 20 May 2014 (UTC)DBrak
If it wasn't already a rather ubiquitous greeting, maybe. -Pennpenn 108.162.250.155 03:29, 30 March 2015 (UTC)
The O HAI meme is a reference to The Room, which came out in 2003, but didn't really gain memetic status until around 2010. Since this comic was published in 2007, that seems unlikely. TV4Fun (talk) 01:59, 21 June 2021 (UTC)

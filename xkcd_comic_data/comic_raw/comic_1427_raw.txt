1427: iOS Keyboard
Explain xkcd: It's 'cause you're dumb.
(Redirected from 1427)

iOS Keyboard

Title text: More actual results: 'Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You [are the best. The best thing ever]', 'Revenge is a dish best served [by a group of people in my room]', and 'They may take our lives, but they'll never take our [money].'
Explanation[edit]
It looks like Randall has been playing with his Apple device after installing the recently released iOS 8 update. The comic is referencing the autocomplete function on the iOS virtual keyboard. A comparable feature is also available on other operating systems, like Android. When the phrase, for example, "Revenge is a dish best served" is typed, the keyboard will suggest “by” followed by “a” then “group” and so on.
The top of the comic, where the keyboard is shown, is a reference to the character Sherlock Holmes, a detective who is often attributed the famous line "Elementary, my dear Watson" (despite having never said that in the canon). In Randall's typing history, the word "dear" is most often followed by "lord", "friend", or "friends," and thus the phone suggests those words as a likely continuation of the line.
The title text continues, by showing more actual results from keyboard predictions from other movie quotes.
The following movies are referenced in the comic and title text:
Movie Character & Situation Full Quote iOS Keyboard Version
Scarface (1983) Scarface is holding an M16, defending his house from Sosa's gunmen, shouting to attackers. "You wanna fuck with me? Okay. You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend!" Say hello to my little sister and my mom and my dad and my friends
The Wizard of Oz (1939) Dorothy with her dog, Toto, in Munchkin land. "Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore." Toto, I've a feeling we're not going to the gym today
James Bond Bond introducing himself, while holding trademark martini. "Bond, James Bond." (nothing follows). Bond, James Bond yields
Serenity (2005) Wash, at the controls of Serenity. "I am a leaf on the wind - watch how I soar." I am a leaf on the wind - watch me play the piano
The Goonies (1985) Mikey standing at the pool in the wishing well, encouraging his troop of misfits to continue on their journey. "Goonies never say die!" Goonies never say anything
The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli pledge allegiance to protect the ring bearer on their mission to destroy the ring. Aragorn: "If by my life or death I can protect you, I will. You have my sword." Legolas: "And you have my bow." Gimli: "And *my* axe." Aragorn: "You have my sword." Legolas: "And my bow." Gimli: "And my" dad
The Princess Bride (1987) Inigo Montoya facing the six fingered man, the man he swore a vendetta against for killing his father. "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You are the best. The best thing ever.
Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982) Khan paraphrasing Shakespeare to justify his vengeance. "Revenge is a dish best served cold" (e.g. Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan (1982): Khan: "...do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?") The quote is not originally from Star Trek but was used already in 1967 in Death Rides a Horse but it is likely that it is the Star Trek reference that is best known to Randall as it is also referenced as a Klingon proverb in Kill Bill: Volume 1. Revenge is a dish best served by a group of people in my room.
Braveheart (1995) Wallace rallying his Scottish army before a seemingly hopeless battle against the English. "They may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM!" They may take our lives, but they'll never take our money
An older comic 1068: Swiftkey is also about keyboard predictions, but without any preceding text (by the Swiftkey keyboard application instead of the iOS 8 keyboard).
It is similar to 2169: Predictive Models.

XKCD references on the XKCD wiki? Who would've thought... 141.101.104.197 06:58, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
I'm so meta even this acronym.
Just saying... 108.162.217.125 07:58, 29 September 2014 (UTC)BK201
I believe that the ios word prediction is personalised based on your previous sentences. My Android autocomplete comes up with "Elementary, my feast of the United Kingdom", and "Toto, I've a feeling we're not going to Switzerland"... --Pudder (talk) 07:53, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
I imagine it is, but it's still interesting to see the defaults before you've added much to the dictionary. I believe this is what Randall is up to. 108.162.216.209 13:00, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
What about adding a reference to XKCD Questions[1]? --Jkotek
Wasn't there XKCD comics about keyboard prediction starting from blank state? --JakubNarebski (talk) 09:57, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
[2] You're welcome. 141.101.89.217 10:04, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
I thought some of the humor for the LoTR reference was the Gimli's dad was a character in The Hobbit. Obviously, Randall didn't work this in, but it could've affected his choice to feature this one in the comic Djbrasier (talk) 16:35, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
Given the outcome of the Scottish referendum on secession, it seems to me that the iOS-updated version of Wallace's quote is perfectly appropriate. --141.101.64.125 23:01, 30 September 2014 (UTC)
Wallace didn't fight the British, he fought the English. 141.101.98.19 (talk) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
Incomplete, anyone? Or is this wiki just goigo explain jokes Randall himself has made? It's probably the latter case, since nobody seems to have had a problem in four years. 172.68.46.41 05:49, 12 May 2018 (UTC)
William Wallace's quote actually goes "They can take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom". 172.68.253.149 01:59, 30 June 2019 (UTC)
Shouldn't the quote shown in the illustration at the top be explained too? It's not a movie per se, but still. --Theanswertolifetheuniverseandeverything (talk) 00:57, 29 March 2020 (UTC)
Done. 172.69.68.106 19:56, 22 October 2021 (UTC)

Future Timeline
↓ Skip to explanation ↓

Title text: Not shown: the approximately 30,000 identical, vaguely hysterical articles titled "WHITE PEOPLE IN [THE US/BRITAIN] TO BECOME MINORITY BY [YEAR]!", which came up for basically any year I put in.
Explanation[edit]
This comic uses the same strategy as comic 715: Numbers, in which Randall uses Google to search for phrases and then charts the results. This one is charted as a timeline, whereas 715 was charted as line graphs. It is a list of things predicted or announced by anyone at any time (the ones you see on Google search using "by the year..." or similar statements).
"2101 - War Was Beginning" is a reference to the opening narration of video game Zero Wing; the same narration is famous for the internet meme "All your base are belong to us". As there are not any other out and out references in the comic, and the rest are actually results that you can find using Randall's methods, "War Was Beginning" was probably the only thing he got when he googled 2101 as well.
Certain events in this comic, e.g. "Social Security stops running surplus", are repeated multiple times. Also, certain bizarre events, like "Apocalypse occurs", or "Flying cars reach market", happen before rather plausible things, like "'Big one' hits California". Certain events, like "Japan is a robot-only country" or "Gillette introduces 14-blade razor" may be related to the recurring theme 605: Extrapolating.
The title text is a reference to a reoccurring scaremonger theory that European people will become a minority or extinct as other ethnicities outbreed them. For maximum scaremongering they will claim this could happen in the near future, complete with extrapolated graphs. In the years since this comic was published these conspiracy theories have come to be known as "the great replacement" or "white genocide". Scaremongers are banking on the idea their target audience will rarely bother to fact check, as analysis of their extrapolations usually reveals incorrect methodology if not outright lies.
This comic has similar features to 1413: Suddenly Popular, 1093: Forget, and 891: Movie Ages.
The predictions[edit]
Year Prediction Further Details Outcome
2012 World population Ever since the advent of modern medicine and the more efficient agricultural processes developed since the Industrial Revolution, the human population had been growing at an unprecedented rate. This has caused some people to worry about overpopulation, which would cause a scarcity of resources and overcrowding, and propose various solutions, most of which involve some form of eugenics. 7 billion is a landmark number because it is a multiple of 1 billion. Close; Earth reached 7 billion in late 2011.
Flying cars For decades, flying cars have been a staple of futuristic sci-fi and technological predictions. So far very few of these predictions, which to tend to hover around 5–10 years from whatever the current date is, have come true. Too early; a flying car was first demonstrated in July 2021.[actual citation needed] You could argue that helicopters count as flying cars, but these are not affordable[citation needed] and hence not widely used by the general public.
Canada cuts greenhouse emissions Currently, the Earth is experiencing an unprecedented period of warming we call global warming, caused in part by greenhouse emissions, which are gases that help trap heat in the atmosphere. Countries have repeatedly gotten together and promised to stop emitting greenhouse gases, but so far they have failed to meet their targets. False. Canada withdrew from the Kyoto treaty in late 2011, and its emissions in 2012 were 18% above 1990 levels (though its population had grown 26% and its GDP had grown 67% in that period).
Apocalypse occurs The end of a cycle of the Mayan calendar on December 22, 2012 has been used in popular culture as a basis for predicting the end of the world. Amongst other things, this included the film '2012'. Some people took this rather more seriously, and actually believed that the world would end on this date. False.[citation needed]
2013 National debt paid off For years, the subject of national debt (in the USA) has been a political point of contention. While both parties theoretically support reducing the debt or paying it off entirely, Democrats are more willing to spend to pull the country out of recessions in the economy and Republicans to cut taxes. The last time that spending did not exceed revenue begin under Clinton, a Democrat, and ended after George W. Bush, a Republican, said that this amounted to taxpayers being "overcharged" and taxes were lowered, followed by the Great Recession. Clinton at one point proposed paying off the debt by 2015. False.
Microchipping Americans Microchips are small computer chips, typically embedded in pets in case they get lost, that contain information about the pet. Some, more paranoid, people worry about the government microchipping everyone in an effort to monitor their activities. False, although RFID implants do exist.
Homelessness ended in MA In 2008, the Commission To End Homelessness in Massachusetts, under Governor Deval Patrick, proposed a plan to all but eliminate homelessness over the next five years (hence the 2013 end-date on the comic). False.
Health care reform law repealed A health care reform law, popularly known as Obamacare, was signed into law in 2010. Ever since, many Republicans have tried (in vain) to repeal it, disliking the idea that government should provide and require healthcare. However, President Joe Biden has stated to restore Obamacare. Too early; almost repealed in 2017.
2014 US leaves Afghanistan After the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) in New York on September 11, 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan, which at the time allegedly hosted the headquarters of al-Qaeda, the terrorist organization behind the attacks. The war has gone on since then, with the public growing increasingly tired of it. Public support then favored a withdrawal, but for military and logistical reasons, the government could not simply move all the US troops in Afghanistan to their home. Therefore, the government promised to eventually withdraw all troops, initially planned to do so by the end of 2014. Too early; the remaining US troops left Afghanistan in June 2021.
GNU/Linux dominant OS An operating system, or OS, is the software that forms the structure in which applications on you computer function. Some typical OSs include Mac OS X, Windows 10, and Linux. The first two of those three are commercial products, sold as a copy by a company. The last is an open-source OS, one that anyone can download and modify free. Typically, open-source software is used by a small number of socially conscious people. False, although Linux-based Android dominated phones since 2011.
2015 New Horizon reaches Pluto The New Horizon spacecraft is a U.S. space mission designed to go to Pluto and take photographs, collect samples, etc. True. It reached Pluto on July 14, 2015.
Healthcare law causes hyperinflation The National Inflation Association warned that the healthcare bill would cause U.S. hyperinflation by 2015. False.
Millennium development goals achieved Millennium Development Goals False.
2016 Baby boomers begin turning 65 Baby boomers are individuals conceived in the years following World War Two, roughly defined as those born from 1946-1959. This isn't so much a prediction as basic math; if you were born in 1946, you turned 65 in 2011. True.
Android takes 38%/45% of market share Android is a popular operating system for smartphones and tablets, created by Google. Market share is the percentage of all devices that use the product, in this case the Android operating system. These entries together are humorous because they cannot both happen at the same time. Too late; passed these marks in 2010. Android OS's market share was already 84.4% as of the third quarter of 2014, showing that both estimates were overly conservative.
Windows phone overtakes iOS iOS is the operating system used by Apple iPhones. At the time of the comic, Apple's mobile OS is much more popular than Microsoft's. The article Randall found predicts that the tables will turn. However, Windows Phone was discontinued in 2017, with support for the last version (Windows Phone 10) ending on December 10, 2019. False.
2017 China completes lunar mission The Chinese space program has plans for extraterrestrial exploration, including a manned mission to the moon. False. The first sample-return mission was completed in November 2020.
Social Security stops running surplus The first of many predictions about the United States Social Security trust fund program, all predicting its decline due to a variety of factors. Too early. Occurred in 2021.
US budget balanced The United States federal budget outlines how much the US government spends on what in a given fiscal year. The budget is not required to be balanced, and so often more money is spent than is earned in revenue, causing the national debt to rise. False. Still pretty negative.
Newspapers become obsolete and die out The increasing popularity of internet media and mobile devices has caused a steady decline in the popularity of print media. False. Though newspapers are in decline, they are certainly not obsolete as of 2017, or 2022, for that matter.
Cosmetic surgery doubles Cosmetic Surgery False. According to the ASPS (American Society of Plastic Surgeons), 1.6 million cosmetic surgeries were performed in 2011, while 1.8 million were performed in 2017, an increase of only 0.2 million.
2018 Social Security stops running surplus Social Security again. Still too early.
Jesus returns to Earth A number of Christians have attempted to predict the return of Christ (a.k.a. the second coming or the rapture) using clues from The Bible, even though the Bible and other religious texts says that "no man can know the date" and that it would be within the lifetime of some who witnessed Jesus's first appearance. Several predicted dates have come and gone. False.
2019 Social Security stops running surplus Social Security again. Still too early.
Every baby has genes mapped at birth Gene Mapping False.
2020 Solar power becomes cheaper than fossil fuels Scientists estimate that more than half of the fossil fuels in existence have already been found and that fossil fuel production will begin to decline due to the scarcity, causing prices to increase. At the same time, improvements in solar technology are causing the prices for solar energy to steadily decrease. True, though only in certain cases.
Keyboards and mice become obsolete Computer input devices are beginning to adopt other inputs, such as trackpads, voice commands, touch screens, and eye tracking. While touch screens in particular are gaining widespread use with the rise of smartphones and tablets, as of 2022 desktop computers that use mice are still fairly common. And while voice-to-text has greatly improved, it still doesn't have the accuracy to replace typing. None of the other text inputs are as fast as a keyboard, and none are suitable for writing program code. False. While touchscreen devices are increasingly common, desktop computers are still very much in use. Mice continue to be used alongside touchscreens and trackpads, and keyboards remain the dominant method of writing on computers.
New Tappan Zee bridge constructed A replacement bridge was announced in 2008. Too late; completed in 2017.
2021 US debt reaches 97% of GDP US Debt Too late; reached in 2011.
US unemployment falls to 2.8% Unemployment in the United States False: because of the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment has actually increased.
Restored caliphate unifies Middle East A caliphate is a form of Islamic political-religious leadership, centred around a Caliph, or successor to the prophet Muhammad. This may be foreshadowing of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which has as its goal the creation of a restored caliphate. False.
Lake Mead evaporates Formed by the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River, Lake Mead is the largest reservoir in the United States (measured by maximum capacity). It hasn't reached its capacity since 1983, due to drought and increased demand for water. This is linked to global warming. False, although water levels continue to fall.
2022 Kilimanjaro snow-free At 5,895 metres, Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa, and the highest free-standing mountain in the world. Around 85% of its ice cover disappeared between 1912 and 2011, and it continues to recede. False.
HTML 5 finished The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) began work on HTML 5 in 2004. Too late; 5.0 specification released in 2014, but incremental updates continue.
Newspapers become obsolete and die out This is the second time this prediction has appeared.
2023 Jesus returns to Earth (again) Again.
US debt passes 100% of GDP This references the common fear that US Debt will exceed GDP, possibly causing economic turmoil. Too late; reached in 2012.
All unprotected ancient forests gone from Pacific Northwest Likely due to a combination of wildfire and deforestation.
2024 Atlantis begins to reappear Atlantis is the name of a fictional/hypothetical island, which is supposed to have been lost beneath the sea. It's not clear why rising sea level would make it reappear.
Orangutans extinct in wild Orangutans are a species of great ape, currently classed as an endangered species, and found only in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra.
China lands men and women on the moon The Chinese space program has plans for extraterrestrial exploration, including a manned mission to the moon. False; the Chinese government planned a manned mission to the moon for the 2030s.
NASA sets up permanent moon base There has been a lot of hype recently about finally returning to the moon, vis-a-vis Orion.
Female professionals pass males in pay There are two possible explanations for this entry: Either it's fear-mongering from misogynists or, more probably, an erroneous extrapolation from the current rate at which female incomes are catching up to male incomes.
2025 World population reaches 8 billion Given current rates, it seems unlikely it will take this long to hit 8 billion, but advances in birth control options and especially their availability in developing nations may slow the current rate considerably. Too late..? This number was reached in late 2022. Hopefully there won't be a reason for the number to suddenly plummet in 2025.
Two billion people face water shortages http://english.pravda.ru/science/earth/28-01-2008/103693-water_crisis-0/
62 MPG cars introduced 62 miles per gallon, ~3.8 L/100km. 62 MPG is a very good mileage rate at today's standard, even though some cars can be driven carefully so as to attain over 100 MPG.
US power fades http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-us-power-will-fade-by-2025/ Hard to know what the precise metric for this would be.
2026 Atlantis emerges completely Atlantis is the name of a fictional/hypothetical island, which is supposed to have been lost beneath the sea. It seems that it has taken 2 years for it to emerge completely.

2038 32-bit timestamps roll over, causing Y2K-level chaos On 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038, the value of time_t rolls over, that is it will return to zero. time_t is a computing standard measurement of time; it is a count of the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970. time_t is used by most computer systems to store date and time information. It is recommended that new software should convert to a 64 bit time_t; indeed, most operating systems designed to run on 64-bit hardware already use signed 64-bit time_t integers. This would give an epoch of 15:30:08 UTC on 4 December 292,277,026,596 (292 billion years away). Of course, legacy systems may not be upgradable so action taken now should prevent this becoming a problem closer to 2038...

The explanation is really messed up. You can hardly tell where one year ends and the next begins. Can someone who's better at editing than me fix this, perhaps by putting a line across the page after each year? GizmoDude (talk) 19:11, 7 April 2016 (UTC)
This one slipped under the transcripting radar. I may do it. --Quicksilver (talk) 20:52, 17 August 2013 (UTC)
Do not talk about radars, just do it. The transcript is done right now, but the explain section still does need a big radar!--Dgbrt (talk) 20:20, 18 August 2013 (UTC)
Find the song! I have no idea so far but the repeating phrase "Social security trust fund exhausted" should match a refrain.--Dgbrt (talk) 20:20, 18 August 2013 (UTC)

Out of curiosity (I'm new to the standards of explainxkcd), are out of date pages considered incomplete? Or is it up to editors to chose when to update a pages explination. I would assume the former, except that would make maintaining the pages significantly more difficult. Also, referencing the Linux takes over. Since Android is now a part of the libux kernel,should thia be changed? It would definently put linux over the 50% mark. Mrmakeit (talk) 05:03, 4 April 2014 (UTC)
Pages can not become out of date, as they refrence the meening of the comic at the time of creation. 108.162.216.209 15:24, 10 December 2014 (UTC)
I would change the 2nd paragraph to say that the entirety of the search results are a super long set-up and "All your base..." is the punch-line. Smperron (talk) 08:46, 10 November 2014 (UTC)
I would correct the entry in 2014 that says that the Taliban are the organisation responsible for the September 11th attacks. The more accurate explanation would be that The US believed Al Qaeda (the real organisation responsible) were hiding out in Afghanistan and that defeating the Taliban, and bringing stability to the country was an important stepping stone towards finding Osama Bin Laden. Of course we now know he was in Pakistan all along, but still that was the original rationale for invading Afghanistan.--141.101.98.192 15:27, 15 December 2014 (UTC)
This further details stuff is wrong about the comic. The lines are just random answers to Google searches. There is no explanation. I move to remove this table, or convert it into links or summaries of the articles in the links. This sucks. It is good enough as it is now without the table (as the table is random and the explanations on the table are incorrect. 108.162.216.209 22:12, 15 December 2014 (UTC)
Let's get to work on the table then. I'm adding suitable references to incomplete sections to aid as jumping off points, from where further expansion can be done on a case-by-case basis. Can you provide some inspiration as to which explanations are most egregiously in need of correction? Pmw57 (talk) 01:44, 8 January 2015 (UTC)
As of 2014 I have noticed that a lot of US sites are moving from html to closed sources such as Adobe so the quote: "The prediction about GNU/Linux Operating Systems is ambiguous" is now fighting through government agencies. Users of Linux trying to access the volcano archive (once supplied by listserv using linux) now have to get access via Windows machines. This has to be the saddest computing news in a long time. Weatherlawyer (talk) 08:19, 4 January 2015 (UTC)
“The prediction about GNU/Linux Operating Systems is ambiguous, as Android (based on Linux) constitutes nearly 50% of the mobile OS market” — GNU/Linux refers to an operating system consisting of the GNU userland toolchain over the Linux kernel. Android is based on Linux but not GNU, therefore, it is irrelevant in GNU/Linux context. 108.162.230.107 11:18, 23 January 2015 (UTC)
Can we change this to Incomplete explanation of the month? Foldark (talk) 22:03, 28 March 2015 (UTC)

Is it just my reading, or does it say "ACHEIVE" instead of "ACHIEVE" where it says something about 192 UN member nations achieving millennium development goals in the comic? (It's under 2015.) --172.68.55.70 21:45, 10 November 2016 (UTC)
No, it reads like this for me too. (Even on the original comic page, where I'd expect it to have been long fixed already.) --172.68.11.87 19:35, 11 November 2016 (UTC)
Some of these predictions seem very realistic. 162.158.59.172 00:22, 25 December 2016 (UTC) Jawa457
I am not sure if this needs to be added or not since it was not happening when the comic was produced and it is not the government doing it but a private tech company microchipping its employees in 2017 Google results since I do not know which news articles will disappear over time. 162.158.62.231 12:03, 17 August 2017 (UTC)
I think we can delete incomplete tag. -- -- 1337-PI (talk) 04:21, 26 February 2021 (UTC) (please sign your comments with ~~~~)
I feel it would have been funny, if a bit confusing, if the first few years numbers after 2037/2038 started referring to, e.g. 1970, 1971, before suddenly "Year 2038 bug finally exterminated". You know it's gonna happen... at least to some poor schmucks somewhere in the world.--Twisted Code (talk) 12:52, 22 November 2022 (UTC)

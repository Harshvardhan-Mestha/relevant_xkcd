Toot

Title text: This is also one of only five identified situations in which a vuvuzela is actually appropriate.
Explanation[edit]
"Toot my own horn" is an idiom meaning to brag. Cueball here is using this idiom to mean that he is not bragging, although he obviously is. However, Black Hat, being the classhole he is, takes this idiom literally and toots (blows) an air horn. An air horn is a horn attached to a can of compressed air, and at close range is extremely loud. Cueball is obviously surprised, as he was expecting Black Hat to start bragging instead of making an extremely loud sound with an air horn.
Black Hat's actions could also be interpreted as punishment of Cueball, who began by claiming that he didn't want to boast about his accomplishments, but then did so anyway. Or he could just be proving that he is a classhole by 1'upping Cueball.
The title text refers to the Vuvuzela, which is a noise-generating instrument, mainly used for making noise at soccer matches in South Africa. This comic was published during the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, and the constant buzzing from vuvuzelas throughout the matches attracted attention and controversy.
Transcript[edit]
Cueball: I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I was first in my class at Caltech.
Black Hat: Really? I don't mean to toot my own horn, but
BRAAAAAAP!
[Cueball falls backward as Black Hat sounds an air horn in his face.]

Discussion
The YouTube link in the explanation is a sarcastic video, that makes anyone who views it laugh out loud at how "seriously" the three men in tuxedos are acting as they blare out awful sounds with those horns. Calling the vuvuzela a "highly sophisticated" instrument based on that video is misleading at the least. 173.245.54.11 16:00, 7 November 2013 (UTC)

-Former and disliked significant other's wedding.

1, 2: actually harmful to your goal, 3 - ethically dubious, but okay, 4 - well, maybe 172.68.10.167 14:09, 8 October 2021 (UTC)
(1, 2) Maybe if you are the victim of predation or a sneaking mission. PoolloverNathan[stalk the blue seas]

The best part about this comic is that it looks like Black Hat is also screaming "BRAAAAAAP!" at the top of his lungs. 108.162.249.205 01:59, 14 January 2015 (UTC)

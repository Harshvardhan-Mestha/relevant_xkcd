Guest Week: David Troupes (Buttercup Festival)

Title text: Guest comic by David Troupes of Buttercup Festival, who is living in that lovely tree outside your window.
Explanation[edit]
This comic is a commentary on relationships. Megan is perfectly happy sitting on the moon (which is impossible)[citation needed] with Cueball, the person she loves. Cueball, however, has his experience ruined when he notices a former bully of his passing by below. After hitting the bully with a rock that he shoots from the moon with his slingshot, he can share in Megan's happiness. (This is practically impossible as well. To start, the rock would most likely fall back down unless Cueball could throw it at escape velocity, but the precision required for such a throw would be extreme, and he would need to account for the movement of the Earth and Moon, as well as the Earth's rotation. Even if accounting for all of that, it would very likely disintegrate in Earth's atmosphere.)
David Troupes is the author of the webcomic Buttercup Festival.
Guest Week was a series of five comics written by five other comic authors. They were released over five consecutive days (Monday-Friday); not over the usual Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule.
The five comics are:
822: Guest Week: Jeph Jacques (Questionable Content)
823: Guest Week: David Troupes (Buttercup Festival)
824: Guest Week: Bill Amend (FoxTrot)
825: Guest Week: Jeffrey Rowland (Overcompensating)
826: Guest Week: Zach Weiner (SMBC)

[The scene broadens.]
Megan: I've never been so happy. I—
Cueball: Hold on—that guy used to dump my notebooks in high school. Give me a moment. Try to keep the moon steady.
[A rock hits a Cueball on the ground on the back of the head.]
[The guy falls and clutches the back of his head.]
[Back to the moon again, where Cueball is leaning his head against Megan while holding a slingshot.]
Cueball: I've never been so happy.

Could the 'Woman' be Megan? 173.245.54.190 16:20, 14 August 2014 (UTC)
Maybe David Troupes wants to make the woman be Megan but can't because he doesn't know how to draw the typical Megan hair we use to identify her. 103.22.200.215 02:25, 17 December 2014 (UTC)
Or she could just be a generic person. It seems like a better idea to presume that a character is a generic unless specifically indicated. -Pennpenn 108.162.249.205 02:21, 21 January 2015 (UTC)
Any woman in xkcd with long black hair is Megan by definition. Megan is not the same person from comic to comic but the generic every woman to Cueballs everyman. Read on the pages for Megan and Cueball. As well as on Multiple Cueballs (see the categories) --Kynde (talk) 09:06, 21 April 2015 (UTC)
If someone threw a moon rock at me, I would pay them. HisHighestMinion (talk) 22:38, 22 April 2016 (UTC)
In Megan's first speech the "I ..." surely stands for "I'm over the Moon ." Sorry. Winter06 (talk)
"Megan is perfectly happy sitting on the moon (which is impossible)" What exact part of it is impossible? Moon has a proper gravitational field and it's solid. Heck, people even walked on it! As for "happily" part, I would be perfectly happy to sit on the moon (for somewhat longer if provided with space suit, but happy in any case). 141.101.104.48 19:20, 4 October 2021 (UTC)

Pore Strips

Title text: I'm sure they're a harmful tool of the cosmetics-industrial complex and all, but my goodness do those strips ever work to pull gunk out of your pores. I was shocked, disgusted, and vaguely fascinated by the result.
Explanation[edit]
This comic shows a box of "Deep-cleaning pore strips," which are a skin-care product designed to clean your pores. You stick them on your face, wait a while, and then rip them off. When they come off, a whole lot of disgusting gunk, like dirt and body oils, is lifted out of your pores with them. The kind shown in the comic, however, is "deep cleaning", and rips out not only the user's pore gunk, but also his entire skull.
The title text indicates that while Randall is aware that pore-cleaning strips are useless and possibly harmful products created to make money by "solving" something that isn't actually a problem, they are quite effective at getting things out of the pores on a person's nose.
The title text also refers to the cosmetics industry as the "cosmetics-industrial complex", which is a play on the term "military-industrial complex", coined by Dwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th president of the United States.
Transcript[edit]

Cyriak reference? --Jiří Dobrý (talk) 10:52, 18 November 2013 (UTC)
I'm not sure because I can't quite see, but I think the strip just pulled out his skull, leaving his skin. This also makes more sense considering the labels on the box. If this is true, someone needs to fix the explanation. Athang (talk) 22:29, 1 May 2014 (UTC)

Please be aware that the little dark spots on your nose (the ones that all look the same size with no obvious swelling) are supposed to be there, they aren't dirt or an infection, and using pore strips to remove them won't help, and they come back anyway. -Pennpenn 108.162.250.162 04:22, 13 August 2015 (UTC)

Those "deep cleaning" strips are an even bigger scam than the "look at all the stuff that was in your carpet" shampoers. They prey on the fastidious of people ignorant about what kind of "mess" is perfectly normal and healthy. —Kazvorpal (talk) 05:26, 25 October 2019 (UTC)

Journal 4

Title text: Man, this emo shit was supposed to be for people who didn't have hats.
Explanation[edit]
In Journal 1, Black Hat explains to Cueball that a hobby of his is to pretend to write in a journal while on the subway, acting embarrassed if anyone sees. He then proceeds to silently scorn the person once they give him any kind of reassurance.
In Journal 2, however, Danish sees through his ruse. She counteracts it by proving that she understands him, and attempts to resign him to the fact that he will never see her again, thus robbing him of the satisfaction of a proper social connection. She leaves, taking his hat in the process. Initially stunned, in Journal 3 he at last regained his hat, the trademark of his personality and attitude, leaving him with the upper hand.
Now, Black Hat has found himself to be in love with Danish, even though this goes against his whole worldview. As stated in the title text, he somehow believed that he was immune to such feelings. What is he to do?
The title text indicates that Black Hat had previously believed that his hat signified, or even caused, immunity from sadness or angst. The meaning of Black Hat's hat is not specified, but it is clearly something important to him. More evidence of the hat's portentous meaning can be seen in 455: Hats.

Snakes on a Plane! 2

Title text: James suggested this, and I'd have to agree. It'd be much worse.
Explanation[edit]
Snakes on a Plane is a 2006 movie starring Samuel L. Jackson. It features (surprisingly) snakes, on a plane, attacking the passengers. This comic proposes a sequel, taking the idea to the next level, making things infinitely worse: snakes on every plane!
To have snakes on every plane is much worse than snakes on just one,[citation needed] as many more innocent bystanders would be injured or killed, and the entire aviation industry would be destroyed. Plus it would be difficult, as there were hundreds of snakes in a single plane in the first movie, so finding enough snakes would be a challenge itself. Since the original movie was generally considered to be quite bad, there is an implied double meaning in the suggested poster, that the movie itself would be "Much Worse Than Last Time."
In the title text, Randall credits James with the idea.
Transcript[edit]

Superimposed on the sky and planes: Snakes... on EVERY Plane!
Much worse than last time.

I think he's also implying that it was a bad film and the sequel will be much worse OmiWan (talk) 23:06, 16 January 2013 (UTC)
I like proposing the parody of "Snakes On The ISS" because one, everything is cooler in space, two, I'm obsessed with the ISS, three, we can imagine the snakes destroy the Soyuz docked and now we have snakes flailing around unthreateningly in microg.

Snakes On The HISS? --
Maybe he's saying planes as in planes of reality, as well as airplanes. 21:29, 15 December 2016 (UTC)~

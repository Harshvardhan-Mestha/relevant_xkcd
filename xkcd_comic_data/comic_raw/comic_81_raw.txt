Attention, shopper

Title text: There's a red convertible outside my building with the license plate 'DADS MNY'.
Explanation[edit]
A common trope (often referenced in TV and film) is a loudspeaker announcement in which a store employee (or anyone else in charge somewhere where people gather, like church or a school) announces that a certain color and model of car has its lights on, or is blocking another car, or is about to be towed, or similar. A license plate is sometimes included to allow the owner to identify that it is specifically their car that is involved.
In this case, Black Hat is up to his old ways as, in addition to announcing that an SRT-10 has its lights on, he also announces that it has had its windshield smashed with a golf club. Black Hat is, of course, holding a golf club, frustrated at the owner’s revolting arrogance. The lights are probably on because the attack triggered the car's alarm system.
The Dodge Viper SRT-10 was a version of the Dodge Viper available on the third and fourth generations of Viper from 2003-2010. It was a very expensive sports car.
The two license plates in the comic are personalized license plates. The one in the comic-proper is clearly "My Toy"; the plate in the title text is most likely "Dad's Money," which Randall suggests is a real plate on a car outside his building, suggesting that the driver's father paid for the car, bragging about how rich their family is. This car will likely also soon earn Black Hat’s wrath.

I always assumed he'd smashed the windshield because the lights were on, rather than the other way around. 108.162.215.90 17:14, 16 October 2014 (UTC)
I think most people just assume that Black Hat smashed the windshield and turned on the lights because the license plate was bragging so obviously about the owners money.Mulan15262 (talk) 14:32, 3 June 2015 (UTC)
I assumed that he had
noticed the car because its lights were on,
seen the licence plate,
found (or stolen) a golf club,
smashed the windshield, and
made the announcement.

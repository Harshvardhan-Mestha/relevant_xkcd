Family Circus

Title text: This was my friend David's idea
Explanation[edit]
The Family Circus is a comic characterized by single-panel round comics with a caption below the comic. Jeffy is a character in Family Circus, and dotted lines representing his wanderings are a frequent theme of Family Circus comics. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental illness that compels the sufferer to perform repetitive actions. Common symptoms include, but are not restricted to, excessive hand washing and repeated opening and closing of a door.
The comic depicts the character Jeffy as having Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and traces his movements over a period of time. The dotted line that depicts his movements returns frequently to the kitchen sink, presumably to repeatedly wash his hands.
In the title text, Randall attributes this idea to the unknown friend David. He did the same in 42: Geico and 51: Malaria.
Transcript[edit]

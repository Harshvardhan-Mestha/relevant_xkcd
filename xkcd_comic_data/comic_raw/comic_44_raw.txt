Love

Title text: This one makes me wince every time I think about it
Explanation[edit]
This comic expresses the view of a love that is unbalanced and unequal. And how one form of love can be painful when closely examined.
It is customary for people in a romantic relationship, when one makes a declaration of love or affection, for the other to make a matching declaration. However, instead of continuing Cueball's escalation by saying the expected response "I love you more!", Megan stops and agrees with him: he does love her more than she loves him. This leads to an uncomfortable dynamic in the relationship. The final frame shows the couple standing in silence.
In the title text, Randall expresses how this comic is shockingly stark in its portrayal of love.
Transcript[edit]
[Cueball and Megan stand facing one another.]
Cueball: I love you!
Megan: I love you!
[Same scene as before.]
Cueball: I love you more!
Megan: Yeah.
[Beat panel.]

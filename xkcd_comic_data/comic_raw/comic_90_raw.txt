Jacket

Title text: We have this conversation at least once a day in my apartment
Explanation[edit]
Cueball clearly means to use fucking as an intensifier. However, the friend (likely intentionally in response to the unnecessary swearing) takes fucking to be an identifier of which jacket is being discussed, and gives a smart-aleck response. His counterpart gets confused by the sarcasm, and the topic is dismissed.
The title text states that this often occurs in Cueball/Randall's apartment.
Transcript[edit]
[Two men stand and talk to one another.]
Cueball: Where's my fucking jacket?
[Friend indicates something behind him.]
Friend: Over there, next to your regular one.
Cueball: My what?
Friend: Never mind.
Trivia[edit]
This comic is the second comic to use an all-caps lettering, the first being 78: Garfield, where the all-caps lettering may have been based off of the lettering in the actual comic strip.

Listen to Yourself

Title text: Man, I just wanted to know how babby was formed.
Explanation[edit]
YouTube is a website for video sharing where anyone can upload and view videos. It is notorious for having some of the most ridiculous, hateful, mean-spirited, nonsensical comments of any mainstream website (a reputation touched upon earlier in 202: YouTube).
Danish tells Black Hat that her computer virus that she is writing reads a YouTube user's comments back to them before it is submitted. Upon hearing their own ridiculous comments read aloud to them, they will realize the stupidity of it and not submit the comment. YouTube later made this a real feature, although it has since been removed again.
The title text is in reference to a post left on the Yahoo! Answers website in 2006 by a submitter known as "kavya," who asks "how is babby formed / how girl get pragnent." The post picked up internet popularity and spawned several flash animations. This was again mentioned in 522: Google Trends and in 550: Density.
Transcript[edit]
[Black Hat approaches Danish typing at a computer.]
Black Hat: What are you writing?
Danish: Virus.
Black Hat: What's it do?
Danish: When someone tries to post a YouTube comment, it first reads it aloud back to them.
Soon, everywhere:
[Cueball is commenting on YouTube with a laptop.]
type type type
[Youtube comment is read back.]
Cueball: ...I'm a moron.
[Cueball leaves desk and partially closes his laptop.]
[Cueball is seen sitting on steps, depressed.]
[Cueball has his head in his hands.]

Anyone out there skilled in the art of making viruses? 173.245.50.72 03:38, 25 July 2014 (UTC)
I admit that I would welcome this virus in order to weed out spelling and grammatical errors, and to make sure the sentences flow properly (when commenting on Youtube my words can become rather salad-y. -Pennpenn 108.162.249.205 01:04, 15 January 2015 (UTC)
Yes! and elsewhere too, there are soooooo many trolls. Dontknow (talk) 23:39, 17 April 2017 (UTC)
It seems to me that the class-holes are finally using there talents for good, albeit with malicious intent. -CreativeName
But... how babby *is* formed???!¿ If you figyour it out, call me at this nunber: 108.162.237.16 05:16, 13 May 2017 (UTC)
Just so you know, our development company Cobalts (cobalts.net) is creating this "virus". ThetaFive (talk) 20:31, 23 May 2017 (UTC)
I want that "virus"
It says Youtube added this as a feature, then removed it. Can someone find a reference for this? Sure (talk) 01:00, 29 May 2021 (UTC)
I want this virus to exist. Trolls would probably regret their decisions, spammers would overload due to how many comments are being read, and normal people wouldn't mind.--172.70.34.191 19:07, 9 December 2021 (UTC)
